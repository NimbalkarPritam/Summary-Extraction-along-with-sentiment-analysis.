0,"This book, in whole or in part, must not be used for any commercial purpose."
1,Free sharing of this book in its entirety is authorized.
2,10 BRAIN vs. That much is clear.
3,"But we want to truly understand our inner self, and why we humans are the way we are."
4,"They are difficult ones, to be sure, and this book is not a casual treatment of this subject, so you can expect real answers to these questions."
5,"For starters, if you believe thoughts and beliefs occur mainly in the brain, you are about to be very surprised."
6,"Humans have long sought answers to deep questions regarding their thoughts and beliefs, since these are about the inner core of human life."
7,We cannot simply look inside ourselves since that would be using self to try to explain self.
8,"And looking to psychology and science will fall far short since most science denies the existence of a soul, and therefore can only deal with the physical interfaces of the body."
9,"There is no better source of truth on the subject of the human soul than the Bible, because God designed this immaterial part of humans, and only He could explain it."
10,"So to understand this subject, we must look to the Designer for answers."
11,This book will challenge the Reader's thinking and question some of your core beliefs about the workings of the inner human.
12,"Otherwise, why would you want to read it?"
13,Mostly enormous failures.
14,"And it is not just about ourselves, but also those around us, those who have preceded us, and those who will come along in the future."
15,"It explains what the Bible says about the inner human, and will do so without apology."
16,"This is an important distinction because we are defining what a true human actually is, which is the immaterial part."
17,"Most cells of the body are constantly being replaced, therefore much of what was formerly our body died and was replaced long ago."
18,No.
19,"The material will someday cease to function entirely, but the same immaterial inner self will live on forever."
20,"The material physical body interfaces with the immaterial real human, but the two exist on different levels."
21,"When it comes to the structure of the material side of humans, science has discovered many things which have improved our health and enhanced our lives."
22,And we are grateful.
23,But science has failed miserably when it comes to the immaterial part of humans because it cannot reach the true inner human which is outside the material realm.
24,"Science calls this ""the hard question,"" because it has no answer regarding why humans can think and form beliefs."
25,"And He has revealed to us a lot more than most people realize, as we will discuss in detail."
26,It would also waste your time since it is mostly wrong.
27,"In other words, science is baffled by the inner human, and cannot understand it at any higher level beyond the material or animal levels."
28,"So they simply call it ""the hard question"" and move on."
29,"When science starts with a false premise, such as denying the existence of the human soul, there can be no basis for deep knowledge about the subject."
30,"But that does not apply to the inner human, which is beyond its reach and understanding."
31,"It is simply an accurate representation of what science has told us, that it does not understand much at all about human thinking and beliefs."
32,"Therefore we look to the Bible for answers, where they have been provided."
33,"The human body is therefore a material mechanism created by God which enables the inner immaterial human to interface with the material universe He created, with other humans, and with Him."
34,"The immaterial human needs a body to support it, both on earth and during eternity, although the eternal one will be much different."
35,"The human body is formed by DNA passed down from our ancestors, but each soul is created directly and uniquely by God."
36,"So we must quickly get beyond viewing the body, including the brain, as the true human when we attempt to understand the immaterial part of humans."
37,"For those who firmly believe the physical body is the actual human, this book is not for them."
38,"They believe that when this mortal body dies, that is the end, and nothing exists beyond the material."
39,"They believe humans are just another animal, although possibly a bit more advanced."
40,This book will not attempt to refute such a basic unbelief system.
41,"For those who have such beliefs, it would be 8 wise to continue reading and use the immaterial soul to think about the eternal future beyond death."
42,We will all live eternally either way.
43,But there are two very different ways of living eternally.
44,One is wonderful and the other is not.
45,"As a preview, the brain is NOT the center of human thought and belief."
46,Therefore it is not the true human.
47,"9 CHAPTER 2 BRAIN vs. We have been taught that the brain is the center of human thought, and therefore the center of humanity."
48,"Human science attempts to convince that the brain is the center of human life and the source of humanity, because it cannot find the soul."
49,"However, the Bible clearly describes the immaterial human soul as the true human, the location of thoughts and beliefs, and the center of our humanity."
50,"Please do not misunderstand, the brain is a wonderful organ designed by God, and incredible in its function."
51,"It is generally an artificial intelligence supercomputer with sensory connectors to the five main senses, plus a central controller for the physical body."
52,However the brain is overrated by those who attempt to attribute the higher level soul functions to it.
53,"This misguided approach is based mainly on the premise that if the soul cannot be discovered in a physical way, then it must not exist."
54,"What, therefore, is the role of the brain?"
55,"But its primary function as related to the inner human is to feed the soul with sensory data brought in by the five main senses which are sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell."
56,"Therefore the brain relieves the soul from thinking about how to perform countless menial tasks, and frees the soul to engage in more meaningful endeavors, and truly live, not just survive."
57,"In this regard, the brain has been delegated certain tasks to perform apart from direct soul involvement."
58,"Meanwhile the soul can focus on higher order living which makes life more enjoyable, and provides the ability to interface with God."
59,Therefore our higher order memories are located in the soul.
60,"It performs emergency actions apart from direct soul involvement based on real-time sensory data due to the constraints of time, including emergency ""fight or flight"" actions."
61,"As such, the brain plays a primary role in the basic survival of the person."
62,"As mentioned, the brain is delegated sensory based tasks and memory associated with the five senses."
63,"Sensory information is funneled from each of the senses through the brain, where the brain acts as a sensory gateway between the body's senses and the soul."
64,One sense supports another.
65,"It makes our surroundings familiar, so we can focus on specific tasks and interests at higher levels."
66,"The primary mechanism of sensory memory is pattern matching, whereby the memory of a previous experience by our senses matches what we sense later, and a match is made, whether exact or similar in some way."
67,"It is how we recognize people, grass, and sky, why we know certain foods when we taste them, or know a car or lawn mower when we hear them, or a breeze when we feel it on our face."
68,"It is the brain which makes the match, then the soul deals with higher level understanding associated with what was sensed."
69,"Additionally, many human actions in life are repetitive ones which use muscle memory information stored in the brain, and these occur apart from direct involvement of the soul."
70,"After the soul decides what will be done, the brain executes most of the task, allowing the soul to focus on the experience itself."
71,"Muscle memory and sensory memory are functions of the brain, so they are actually brain memory, or brain programming."
72,"They are stored in and performed by the brain instead of the soul, unless 12 the soul decides to get involved."
73,The difference is a matter of low order task accomplishment vs. higher order living as a human.
74,"Think about the intricacies involved in walking and running, a golf or tennis swing, ice skating, bicycle riding, basketball shooting, baseball and football throwing, and so on which are based on muscle memory stored in the brain and only supported from the soul."
75,"Brain damage can interfere with soul outputs and inputs, but such damage does not change the soul, or eliminate what was already contained in it."
76,"Therefore a person with memory diseases such as Alzheimer's or dementia cannot get what is in the soul out through the brain, meaning the core person and their memories are not lost or even changed."
77,"The soul can be closed off to some degree by the body, but that does not destroy what was already in the soul."
78,This will be discussed in more detail later.
79,We recognize them from the brain.
80,"Think about driving down a road, and all the potential sensory inputs as the scenery goes whizzing by us."
81,"All that sensory data would quickly overwhelm the soul if it were just dumped as raw, unfiltered data into the soul."
82,"The soul functions at a high level, so most sensory data must be sorted and filtered in the brain before being turned over to the soul."
83,"During this process, which turns raw data into information, most of the raw data is disregarded as irrelevant."
84,Some of that higher order information becomes the source of thoughts and thinking.
85,"And these occur in the soul, not in the brain."
86,Sometimes the brain and soul get in each other's way.
87,"That happens when the brain muscle memory knows how to perform a task, but the soul decides to try to ""help."""
88,"For instance, Olympic level ice skaters can routinely perform flawlessly in practice, but under the intense pressure of competition the soul starts thinking about consequences, about winning and losing, whether something will disappoint family and friends, what the news will say about 14 any failures, and other higher order thoughts, but not necessarily helpful ones."
89,The soul may even make suggestions in the middle of a complex task.
90,"A discordance occurs, and the brain cannot concentrate."
91,We have all been there.
92,"Not necessarily ice skating, but many things in life go like that."
93,"The point is that if the entire task were done from muscle memory out of the brain, without soul interference, then all the practice would result in a much better outcome."
94,"But we have two parts, brain and soul, which can become involved when the stakes are raised."
95,And this is why people who play sports at a high level must perform from their brain with a quiet soul.
96,Not always easy to do.
97,"The soul can be very insistent, and that is when pressure is felt, and the consequences of failure are considered."
98,"Sights, smells, tastes, things touched, and sounds which were experienced and are now in memory as brain patterns can be used for matching."
99,"The connections between the material and immaterial are mostly on the immaterial side, meaning it is the human soul which provides the primary interfaces with the material brain."
100,"There are no material ""dangling wires"" in the brain which lead to an unseen soul."
101,"When the electrical signals are gone, it shows the soul is gone, even if the physical body continues to function otherwise to some degree."
102,Thoughts and beliefs go way beyond the senses and interaction with the universe and muscle memory.
103,"Our thoughts and beliefs occur inside the human soul, which is the inner human, the image of God, which He designed to enable humans to have thoughts and beliefs as He does, and therefore to be capable of understanding and interacting with Him, and also loving Him."
104,"And only a soul can truly love, and have thoughts and beliefs related to love."
105,Therefore we can understand why the human brain is not the true human.
106,"It performs the lower order functions for the person, and does not survive beyond death."
107,"Therefore the brain is not the source of thought, beliefs, emotion, conscience or storage for higher level human memory."
108,True love does not come from the brain.
109,Trusting God does not occur in the brain.
110,"This makes the brain the physical intermediary, not the true human."
111,"But first, let us take a short side-trip to examine how and why humans are different than animals."
112,16 CHAPTER 3 HUMANS vs.
113,"ANIMALS God created both humans and animals, and He designed them to be very different types of creatures."
114,"He created humans to live eternally, and animals to live only temporally."
115,"Because of that, animals have no soul, and do not think in the human sense of the word, nor do they hold beliefs."
116,"This is why humans are not animals, since animals have nothing immaterial about them."
117,"Humans have a greatly enhanced artificial intelligence supercomputer brain, but we also have an immaterial soul connected to it which makes us very different than animals, and also makes us eternal."
118,"But since animals have no soul, God gave them something unique which He did not give to humans, as we will see."
119,"The real life of a human is in the soul, although the human material body can be viewed as physically alive."
120,But the life of an animal is entirely in the body.
121,"Most people think of human superiority over animals as a given, but that superiority does not come from the physical brain, but rather from the soul of humans."
122,"Humans could not be at the top of the animal kingdom without a soul, because the material part of humans is actually inferior to many animals."
123,"It is our thinking which makes us superior, not our physical attributes, and that thinking is only in the soul."
124,"Humans are virtually devoid of enhanced instincts, and have only a few basic ones to enable newborns to get started in life."
125,"17 However, evolutionary theories assume that humans are animals without souls, and put humans at the top of the evolutionary chain."
126,"Without those higher order capabilities, humans as animals would have become extinct quickly in a body not designed for animalistic living in a wild world."
127,"Rather, God made humans far more capable than animals, more capable than any brain could ever become, by putting a soul inside."
128,Therefore the suppositions concerning thought and belief in humans are not the same as for animals.
129,"Beyond that, we hold beliefs, and can believe in God and learn to love Him."
130,"We think about the future, and the past."
131,"But the real missing link is that no animal has a soul, and evolution could never make a leap from no soul to a soul, from purely material to material plus immaterial."
132,"Therefore, creatures without souls could never evolve into souled creatures."
133,To go from no soul to a soul is not an evolutionary step.
134,Humans think and believe from an immaterial soul.
135,Animals cannot since they have none.
136,"Therefore the real missing link of evolution, the wall of impenetrability between animals and humans, is the soul which yields thoughts and beliefs."
137,"This is why the evolutionist must believe that humans are animals with no soul, because the human soul creates an impassable barrier between animal and human, one which evolutionary theory cannot accommodate."
138,The material cannot evolve into the immaterial.
139,Even evolutionists believe this.
140,"And if anyone wonders how they can still believe what they believe, that is a later chapter in this book."
141,No animal comes anywhere near the global dominance humans have exerted on the earth.
142,There is no way they ever could.
143,Maybe a pat on the head or such.
144,That is about all.
145,"No higher order thinking there, just instincts."
146,But advanced animals do have the five senses in common with humans.
147,"But the endpoint for that sensory information is the brain of animals, rather than the soul in humans."
148,"They can figure out how to defeat a squirrel-proof bird feeder, but that is simply trial and error."
149,"For the sake of illustration only, if a human body could function with the soul removed, the result would be, at best, a dysfunctional animal."
150,"That is because the higher order thoughts and beliefs would be gone without a soul, and since the human brain has almost no instincts, it would have a significant disadvantage for survival."
151,"So if a human body could ""live"" without a soul, it would not function like what we expect from a human."
152,"In fact, it would never have consciousness."
153,This can and does happen.
154,"The physical part of humans was not designed to have the brain function as a capable animal apart from the soul, which is much different than how animals are designed."
155,"God did not create humans as animals, and He does not want the physical human body to be capable of acting as an animal if a soul is not present."
156,"Such creatures would be robots or androids, not humans."
157,"Humans have almost no instincts, except for newborns in order to get them started in life -- nursing, swallowing, and a few others."
158,"But enhanced instincts are programmed into almost all animals, from large mammals down to tiny insects, to enable them to survive."
159,It is the instincts which make up for their lack of a soul.
160,Baby turtles run toward the ocean at birth.
161,"Mosquitoes find us no matter how we try to avoid them, and they have a ""brain"" the size of a pinhead."
162,"We can see instinctive behaviors in most animals around us, and many other instincts are less obvious."
163,"But God did not give humans such instincts because He gave us a soul and requires us to think our way through life, not act on instincts to merely survive."
164,"For humans, God wants more from us than mere survival, He wants us to know Him, understand Him, and maybe even learn to love Him."
165,"For animals God wants them to do what He programmed them to do, and support humans on many levels."
166,"Instincts take the place of a soul in animals, but it is not thinking or even cognitive, and it is not immaterial."
167,"It is programming in their brains, often very tiny ones."
168,"We see something that looks like affection and appreciation from them, but it is not based on thinking."
169,There is a stimulus and they provide a response.
170,"Or maybe they ignore it, if they are a cat."
171,"They remember a previous stimulus, and they might even respond in anticipation well in advance."
172,"Some actions are complex, to be sure."
173,"Fascinating, but simply supercomputer calculations plus a lot of trial and error repetition."
174,"They just want to eat and will work tirelessly to achieve this basic instinctive goal, even when the ground is covered with acorns."
175,But they do not have a soul.
176,"Animals do not have the ability to think in the abstract, or think at all in our use of the term."
177,"They want to remain alive due to instincts, but they do not know they are alive."
178,"Humans can think the abstract thought ""I am alive"" and know the profound implications."
179,Animals cannot think at all in the way we view the issue.
180,Humans do not simply think better than animals.
181,"We think, and they do not."
182,"We have beliefs, and they do not."
183,They have advanced instincts and we do not.
184,The difference is the soul.
185,The only source of thought and beliefs.
186,"20 It is the human soul which can believe in God, and can learn to love Him."
187,No animal has ever believed in God.
188,And God created animals because of humans.
189,They were put on earth to support humans in numerous ways.
190,God would not use an evolutionary process to create humans.
191,"God gave humans a soul, but not animals because He has different purposes for each."
192,"Sorry, no soul."
193,"But there will be new types of animals in eternity because we will live on a New Earth with new plant life as described in the Bible, so there will likely be new forms of animal life as well."
194,"Just not your former pet because the physics and environment will be very different, not based on atoms and molecules and such."
195,"But before we leave this issue, which includes instincts, we have discussed that God did not create humans with much in the way of instincts."
196,"The Sinful Nature is animalistic, because at its core it is instinctive in a negative sense, not in a positive sense."
197,"It makes humans capable of anger, hatred, lusts and violence, and therefore it is animalistic."
198,"Not what God intended for humans, but because of sin we have it."
199,"Some people give in to it, while others control it to a greater or lesser degree."
200,But it affects all humans.
201,More on these issues later.
202,"Now that we understand the humans vs. animals issue, we see the absurdity of evolution theories, and also appreciate what God did when He created animals with their unique enhanced instincts."
203,"Now we will proceed during the next several chapters to dive even deeper into the intricacies of the human soul in ways few have ever explored, let alone understood."
204,"As the source of thoughts and beliefs, the soul expresses the essential traits of being human, namely, we think, we make decisions about important life issues, we form beliefs, and we know we exist, all in our immaterial inner human."
205,"But because humans have a soul, we can think high level thoughts and have beliefs in that soul, centered on knowing these things matter to self, to others, and to God."
206,Forever.
207,Nothing remaining.
208,"Without the soul, nothing about our existence would matter since it would only be very temporary."
209,"God certainly would not be part of such an absurdity, which is why He gave us a soul which will live forever."
210,Therefore our life matters.
211,The soul gives life meaning and purpose.
212,"Humans are required by God to use our soul to make decisions and choices, ultimately for or against Him."
213,And only a self-aware being can ask why they exist.
214,which is answered only by the Bible.
215,We are here to make decisions for or against God.
216,"And the choices we make determine future outcomes, both during our lifetime and forever."
217,"One of those decisions might be about what we eat for lunch, and another about our relationship with God."
218,"One has eternal implications, and the other does not."
219,And those decisions are not from a brain in the body.
220,The soul is humanity and forever.
221,"All beliefs are formed in the inner human, and belief is what God requires of 22 humans if they are to have eternal salvation."
222,"That alone makes beliefs the most important issue in life, because it determines our eternal status."
223,"Newborns do not enter the world with thoughts, beliefs or self-awareness."
224,"The newborn's soul must learn and recognize that there is such a thing as the world outside of itself, then learn about it and how it operates."
225,"Those which the newborn will later recognize as ""people"" show up regularly and then the baby eats, which satisfies a basic need."
226,Massive amounts of sensory data is experienced.
227,Language is heard repetitively.
228,"Basic thoughts begin to be formed in the soul, usually about food, discomfort, and other needs."
229,"And on it goes as the soul is developed into something which can think, and eventually form beliefs about the world around it."
230,"Therefore the human soul develops first by taking in empirical sensory data as the senses identify the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch sensations we encounter, categorize them, and try to match them with sensory memories in the brain."
231,"At first memories are mainly sensory, but eventually thoughts and beliefs develop life memories."
232,"And we know it was us who experienced all those things, not someone else, so we know we exist."
233,We are self-aware.
234,"Sorry, but that is backward."
235,"That is because humans are not born thinking, even though they exist, so the concept ""I think, therefore I exist"" works only after many years of empirical sensory learning."
236,"Newborns exist, but do not think."
237,"The ability to think must be learned, because at birth the soul is blank and empty, and therefore cannot have thoughts or be self-aware."
238,"Empirical sensory information must be taken into the soul first by the five senses, then through the brain, and then into the soul where the foundation for thinking is formed over time."
239,"All of this makes empiricism, which Descartes was trying to avoid, the foundational basis of rationalism and deductive reasoning."
240,There is also a difference between the immaterial parts of believers and unbelievers.
241,"This involves the human spirit, which is separate and distinct from the soul."
242,"We define ""believers"" as those who have believed in Jesus Christ as their Savior, and we define ""unbelievers"" as those who have never believed in Jesus Christ as their Savior."
243,That one specific belief separates those who are on the side of God from those who are not.
244,"There are believers and there are unbelievers, a clear separation among humans."
245,The immaterial part of humans is amazing.
246,This is where beliefs come into play.
247,Beliefs are often strongly held and will determine what conclusions will be drawn.
248,"Beliefs are powerful influencers which are not easily changed, because they are at the core of what a person thinks about themselves, and therefore who they really are."
249,"If you ask a person to tell you who they are, they will ultimately describe their beliefs."
250,Humans can be incredibly logical and at the same time hold outrageously illogical thoughts and beliefs in certain specific areas of life.
251,"And yet they are not considered to be mentally unstable, or to suffer from a diagnosable mental illness."
252,"They may appear to think abnormally to you, but they are not abnormal in a medical sense."
253,And they may think you are abnormal.
254,It all seems unexplainable.
255,"But the Bible makes sense of all of it, and these issues will be explained as we proceed."
256,Many of the answers will likely be surprising.
257,Maybe even shocking.
258,"Science, philosophy, and medicine cannot explain what constitutes a true human, which is the soul."
259,Most do not even believe there is such a thing as a soul.
260,"It supports the soul, which is the center for high level thoughts and beliefs."
261,"It is the ultimate destination of the sensory information fed into the brain, which in turn is manipulated by the soul whereby we make decisions and figure out where we are headed with our life, and also remember where we have been."
262,"It is where we have self-awareness, knowing we exist as a unique individual."
263,"That brings us to the point where we can now discuss the design of the human soul, its components, and how it works."
264,"Although His essence obviously goes far, far beyond human capabilities, the inner human is in the overall image of God in such areas."
265,That is because God wants us to be capable of interacting with Him by making free will choices based on independently derived thoughts and beliefs.
266,"God did not design humans as robots or puppets which must only do what they are programmed or made to do, because such a creature would not be capable of choosing to love God, so it could only mimic something like love, but it would not be genuine love."
267,Only a truly free will can make choices for or against God.
268,"So in order to interact with God, humans must have a degree of likeness with God which provides a basis for a true relationship."
269,"And that is how God designed the inner human, in His image."
270,The human soul is made up of several parts.
271,"(Note: For the purpose of clarity, these will be capitalized when referring to them as soul components, unless quoting from the Bible.)"
272,"Besides the soul, there is also the human spirit component of the inner human, which is also immaterial, but is separate and distinct from the soul, although intimately connected."
273,"The human spirit will be covered in a separate chapter, but as a quick overview, it is the spiritual part of the inner 27 human which allows us to interact with God, since He is Spirit."
274,"(John 4:24) Therefore the soul defines us as rational human beings, and the human spirit makes us spiritual beings."
275,"But we must take things one step at a time, so we must first cover the soul in greater detail."
276,Therefore we will need to delay discussing the human spirit for now.
277,But your patience will be rewarded.
278,"But as we know from the book of Genesis, perfectly created humans did not comply with the requirements placed on them by God, and so they sinned in revolt against God."
279,"That led to distortions in the human soul, mainly an added component called the Sinful Nature, which became an attachment to the soul."
280,"At the same time the two humans lost their human spirit, which was spiritual death, resulting in alienation from God."
281,We will discuss later how God found a way to enable their human spirits to be restored or regenerated by salvation.
282,"God did not design humans that way, but rather they added this feature to their souls apart from God's will."
283,"In the Garden of Eden when the man and woman sinned, both acquired the Sinful Nature by choice, although for the woman it was a deceived choice."
284,"God had designed perfection, but humans rebelled and caused distortions and added imperfections to the soul."
285,"Thoughts and beliefs changed for all of us after that point because the original parents made this choice for all humanity, making the Sinful Nature an addition to the soul of all their descendants (with the exception of Jesus Christ, as we will discuss)."
286,"Then we will look at the human spirit, which is a separate part of the inner human, once the soul is understood."
287,"Let us begin with the primary focus of the soul, which is the Heart."
288,The Heart is the central controller of the soul which integrates all the complex components and facets of the inner human.
289,"It is the Captain of the ship, and therefore the responsible agent for what the person thinks, believes, and does."
290,"The Heart makes decisions for the soul, and expresses thoughts and intentions toward the outside world and also toward God."
291,"As such it is the center of the free will of the human, and also where self-awareness resides."
292,"When discussing the inner human the Bible most often refers to the Heart since it is the main component of the soul, rather than using the word ""soul"" itself."
293,This shows the importance of the Heart as the main component and decision maker of the soul.
294,That is not how the Bible explains the Heart.
295,"God is highly focused on the thoughts and intentions of the person, and He evaluates each person based on their Heart."
296,It makes all the final decisions.
297,"And it can either act in compliance with God's will and plan or make decisions contrary to them, meaning it is the center of free will in humans."
298,"We will discuss why later, but for now we will stick with the soul component descriptions to keep building an understanding of how the soul is designed, and how it functions."
299,"Overall, the Heart is about decision making."
300,That is its primary role.
301,Salvation comes from the Heart's decision to believe in Jesus Christ as Savior.
302,"And the Heart is important in our post-salvation spiritual life: ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding."
303,"In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."""
304,And the human spirit is our spiritual side.
305,"And a human spirit is required to interact with God in any way, as spirit to Spirit."
306,"And while we are on that subject, it takes both a soul and human spirit to be in the image of God."
307,"Without a human spirit, part of that image is missing."
308,"For those who believe the Heart is primarily a source of good intentions, think again."
309,"Satan has a Heart, and it is pure evil."
310,"The following are some of the many verses which describe the Heart as evil under certain conditions, especially when God is rejected by a majority of humans: Genesis 6:5 ""Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."""
311,"Instead, the Heart is always used as the source of man's cognitive integrating functions, namely thoughts and beliefs."
312,"The human physical brain is a material interface and sensing device which enables the immaterial part of man to interact with the material world, especially on a sensory level."
313,Therefore the Heart is the key component of the soul.
314,"When the thoughts and beliefs of the soul are finalized and put in place, it is done by the Heart."
315,MIND The soul component mentioned in the Bible second only to the Heart is the Mind.
316,"By design, the Mind is closely aligned with the Heart as its chief advisor."
317,That means the Mind is the busiest part of the soul.
318,In this regard the Mind is the soul component which deals most directly with inputs coming through the brain from the outside.
319,"And not just as academic subjects, but rather being able to relate to the world in all its complex physical aspects."
320,"When an issue requires some contemplation, the Mind sorts out the facts related to what the soul should do, and advises the Heart as to how to proceed."
321,"As such the Mind is designed to be the primary contemplative engine of the soul, sorting out facts, pulling in memories related to issues under consideration, using established soul beliefs as policy, considering the issues in view of right and wrong, forming conclusions, mulling things over, pondering why things are the way they are, forming conclusions, and making recommendations to the Heart."
322,"After the Mind figures issues out, the 32 Heart makes the final decision about what the soul will do with the information."
323,"The Mind does the heavy lifting part of the thinking process, and the Heart does the integration and finalization part of the thinking process."
324,"This is why the Bible says that both the Mind and Heart think and possess knowledge and understanding, because what the Mind advises based on the deep thinking part of the process, the Heart usually accepts and finalizes at the finishing stage of thinking."
325,The chief advisor to the Heart.
326,"A faculty of technical understanding, contemplating, deciphering, and figuring things out for the soul (complex sensory data, math, engineering, physics, etc.)."
327,2.
328,The key to the soul's understanding and knowledge of the outside world.
329,3.
330,"The ""logic"" engine of the soul."
331,Determines acceptability and quality of the data and information which comes into the soul.
332,4.
333,"The component of the soul which oversees the Conscience and Memory, since the Mind is their primary interface."
334,"In the ancient Greek the word for Mind is ""dianoia"" which is a term used by Plato for a type of thinking, specifically about mathematical and technical subjects."
335,"It employs mental tools and takes inputs from the other parts of the soul, and for believers it receives spiritual inputs from the human spirit."
336,"Therefore it engages to recognize the familiar, and also to decipher and figure out that which is not clear, to compare new things with previous knowledge, to develop conclusions, to put issues into perspective."
337,"That can be technical, mathematical, visualization skills (the ""eyes of the mind"" in Ephesians 1:18)."
338,When functioning properly it is very logical.
339,"As the master thinker component of the soul it solves cognitive problems, sorts things out, and makes sense of the world around us."
340,"Once again it is important to note that thinking is not done in the brain, but rather the brain interfaces with the outside world to bring sensory data to the Mind of the soul where that sensory data is used for the purpose of figuring things out and putting them into perspective, which results in an understanding of the issue, or a conclusion that more information is needed to understand the issue."
341,The issue of relative intelligence often measured by IQ is an interesting issue which shows the relationship between the brain and the Mind of the soul.
342,"Although actual thinking occurs in the soul, data from the outside world comes through the brain where it is semi-processed before going on to the soul."
343,"Some people process raw data in the brain better than others, or maybe just certain specific types of data better than others."
344,Therefore IQ is a mixture of brain and soul functions.
345,"Otherwise all humans have the same thinking capabilities in the soul, which far exceed even what a super-genius is able to achieve while alive in a human body."
346,Some are geniuses at math while others struggle.
347,Certain people have strong visualization skills.
348,"Some have high functioning capabilities as artists, engineers, physicists, architects, garden designers, leadership, writing or whatever."
349,"Individuals have varying degrees of abilities in a wide variety of areas, and no person has high levels of everything."
350,"Therefore brain capabilities associated with processing and transferring data to the soul causes people to have different levels of ability to think at a high level in certain areas, which is generally called IQ."
351,"Therefore it is not always truly ""logical"" even though it is the engine of logical thinking, so the Mind is not always correct about its understanding and knowledge."
352,"Sometimes the understanding and knowledge it had previously created are wrong, so the new understanding and knowledge developed based on it will also likely be wrong."
353,Sometimes the sensory data is misinterpreted.
354,"And sometimes other parts of the soul interfere with the proper functioning of the Mind by inserting distortions, often based on the person's overall belief system."
355,"This is where beliefs become a powerful influencer in the soul, since they narrow options for thinking, either for good or bad."
356,"These beliefs are often ""hardened"" into the soul, creating inflexibility."
357,"Therefore the Mind as the ""logical"" component of the soul can be entirely illogical."
358,This becomes the basis of a split soul to at least some degree.
359,"When this is the regular status of the person, the Mind will gravitate to and align with the Sinful Nature in some way or another, as these verses indicate: Rom 12: 7 ""…because the mind set on the flesh [Sinful Nature] is hostile toward God; for it does not submit itself to the law of God [God's Word]…"" Colossians 1:21 ""Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior."""
360,"The ammunition for the human spirit is the Word of God, while the Sinful Nature gets plenty of firepower from everyday living and seeks to oppose the will of God."
361,"This shows the importance of learning and growing from the Word of God instead of relying on whatever comes in through everyday living as the source of one's ""truth."""
362,All of this means the person can have technical competency while at the same time have illogical beliefs about many other things in life.
363,"We might ask: ""That person is not dumb, so how can they think that way?"""
364,"As such the Mind can try to figure things out using premises provided by distorted beliefs in the soul, which reside in the Heart, and the result will be distorted conclusions."
365,"That means a person can be brilliant technically but ""walking around"" ignorant and confused."
366,"More details on this issue later, since we must stick with describing the soul components at this stage."
367,"Next, we discuss Memory."
368,"Learning would be irrelevant, since nothing would be stored."
369,"In order to think, there must be information stored somewhere with which to form thoughts, and that location is the soul Memory."
370,"In this regard, the soul component Memory works very closely with brain memory, although the two exist at different levels."
371,The issues of soul Memory and remembering are mentioned in the Bible over 275 times.
372,"Every human is born with no memories, meaning a blank soul Memory, and therefore cannot think at that point."
373,"And although the Memory begins to be populated soon after birth, the initial information is at first very basic, since a foundation of sensory information must first be built up in the brain before the more advanced soul Memory can be populated to any degree."
374,This is because the brain sensory memory supports the soul Memory.
375,"The higher level memories of the life, which are the important memories related to humanity, are located in the soul, so it is important to understand how the Memory works."
376,"If not for the Memory, every sensory input from brain to soul would be new to us."
377,Over and over again.
378,"We would not remember what food is, or grass, or a chair, or parents, or anything at all."
379,"Humans could not survive, because they lack the instincts God gave animals."
380,"As we have discussed, instincts in animals make up for their lack of a soul."
381,"Humans are born with very few instincts, and must rely on adults to nurture them."
382,"God gave animals extensive instincts to provide for their survival from birth, but He requires humans to live out of their soul."
383,"At some point there is recognition of people such as parents, who are remembered in a positive way."
384,"It takes a long time for a newborn to develop enough memories in the soul to begin to think, even at a basic level."
385,"Therefore humans are not born thinking in the soul, but rather they are born sensing with the brain."
386,"The senses take in sensory data from the five senses, which builds up a repository of sensory memories, which eventually begins to develop and populate soul memories."
387,Only then can soul thinking begin.
388,"38 Without the Memory there would be no understanding of loved ones, or even who you are."
389,"But because we have the soul Memory, during eternity the person will remember who they were while they lived out their natural life on earth."
390,"If human memories were located in the brain, they would vanish at the point of death."
391,This applies to both believers and unbelievers.
392,"Without the Memory of the soul, the Mind would have nothing to use for comparison when trying to figure things out."
393,And there would be no relationships among people since they would not be recognized as family or friends.
394,We would not be able to learn about God and His plan for us.
395,All of this shows why the Memory is key to allowing the Mind to build upon previous learning so that it can figure things out in the present time.
396,"There are three levels of soul memory, which are generally speaking short term, long term, and archival."
397,Therefore most information which goes into short term memory never gets into long term memory.
398,"We cannot normally describe a car we just passed, or the features of an object we briefly saw when in a store, or most objects we encounter which were not important to us."
399,"Therefore an extraordinary event is stored in greater detail in our Memory, because our soul focuses intently on the details."
400,Memory can be stored in various ways.
401,"Therefore most visual memories are stored in the form of a mental image or video, often associated with previously learned mental images which allow them to be categorized."
402,"Shape, size and color (generally light or dark only) would be the things retained longer than other details."
403,"Color can be retained longer if it is an expected color, such as grass is usually recalled as green."
404,"Most images disappear within seconds and cannot be remembered, and many others imprint just a vague image."
405,"For instance, we have a mental snapshot of the car we parked next to earlier today."
406,Probably only light or dark.
407,"Sedan, SUV, or truck?"
408,Probably.
409,Less likely.
410,We thought that was different.
411,And that is the key.
412,"So we know it was 40 a light colored car, sort of small, a sedan, with that odd sunscreen."
413,"Otherwise it is whatever caught our attention because it was unusual or required our attention, if anything at all."
414,"Smell is often the longest lasting form of memory, and generally fades the least."
415,"Tastes and sounds last a long time in comparison to visual memory, and also touch to some degree."
416,"But most non-visual memories cannot be recalled easily to mind to the degree visual memories can, but rather they must be re-experienced to recall them in any detail."
417,"We cannot conjure up the exact smell of fresh apple pie just by thinking about it, but when we smell it again, we easily recognize it."
418,But Memory can be hard to control.
419,Getting rid of bad memories is very difficult.
420,"That is because they are imprinted due to the impact they had, and we continue to recall them even though we do not want to."
421,"It sits seared into a photographic image in soul memory, taking up valuable space."
422,And not helpful.
423,"We are told to forget our failures so we can move on and grow spiritually, as the Apostle Paul said ""But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."""
424,Sort of.
425,"The soul Memory keeps stuff moving along, making way for new memories."
426,At some point only the outline remains if it is not accessed again.
427,"Colors and other details fade and get lost, because the space is needed."
428,I do not know.
429,But memories are not forever.
430,"We are told by the Bible to remember certain things, such as to worship God."
431,We must know when and how to do both.
432,"Isaiah 46:8 ""“Remember this, keep it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels."
433,"9 Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other."""
434,"42 Lamentations 3:20 ""I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me."""
435,There are some other unusual aspects of soul Memory.
436,"One is how we forget something important to us, and even though we try and try, we cannot recall it."
437,Later it pops into our Mind and we remember it.
438,We have all experienced forgetting something we knew well at some point.
439,We try to recall the name of a person.
440,We give up and forget about it.
441,Then a day or more later the name just pops into our Mind and there it is.
442,We were not even trying to remember any more.
443,"We do not know how, but we do know that it happens."
444,"Sometimes things get misplaced, or the soul may have moved it to archive memory which is not readily and immediately accessible, but it can be accessed given a little time."
445,"It would be interesting to know how this happens, but to know that it does happen deepens our understanding of the complexity of the human soul, and why higher order memories are not a brain function."
446,"Of course, this is simply to illustrate how complex the soul can be, that the Memory has several components, which are short term, intermediate and archival memory."
447,"So there is a rather complex method of sorting, storing, and retrieving memories."
448,And sometimes it just takes time to retrieve something which was misplaced.
449,"Many items are put into a current memory which is constantly being emptied, but not the things we found most important."
450,"But our Memory can only handle a certain amount of those, so most things are moved off into a longer term memory, or an archival memory, or even into the trash bin."
451,"We will discuss dreaming later, but dream information is generally put into a very short term memory, and is even dumped while sleeping unless it is so significant or startling as to be put into storage for later analysis when awake."
452,Then we move on and forget it.
453,"When we discuss dreaming and how the soul works while asleep in a later chapter, we will see that the soul functions differently during sleep."
454,A very interesting subject which requires further discussion.
455,"Next we will explore the Conscience of the soul, which is also a sub-component of the Mind of the soul."
456,"This book is about thoughts, thinking, and beliefs, so it is important to note the Conscience is that part of the soul where beliefs associated with right and wrong are stored."
457,"What is stored there may be accurate, distorted or false, but they are the beliefs of that person nonetheless."
458,As such the Conscience sets the parameters of acceptable thought and actions for the entire soul.
459,"The beliefs are formed over the life of the human, and they narrow the focus of the Heart's decision making process."
460,"Therefore, contrary to popular opinion, the Conscience does not automatically have correct values which line up with what God intends, since God does not directly populate the human Conscience with His truth."
461,"A properly aligned Conscience would have Biblical values, but that is rare."
462,Most people have a Conscience which aligns with a narrow set of rights and wrongs which can either be deeply held or easily dismissed as the occasion requires.
463,Therefore a Conscience is not by definition something inside all humans which knows right and wrong.
464,And it is certainly not a function in the brain.
465,"A Conscience is developed over 44 time by past thoughts, teaching, experiences, and actions of the individual."
466,"The Conscience is empty when the person is born, just as the rest of the soul, so it is not filled with proper standards from birth."
467,Rather it is developed by each individual person.
468,Therefore a Conscience is not necessarily a proper rudder on human behavior.
469,"Sometimes it is simply a self- designed excuse for people believing they are not so bad after all, and better than many other people."
470,God does not condone using the Conscience to condemn others for their personal failures.
471,"The Sinful Nature tempts the Heart to sin, often by excusing the act as not truly all that bad."
472,The Sinful Nature is constantly working to chip away little by little at the beliefs held in the Conscience.
473,"The Conscience is subordinate to and closely tied to the Mind: Titus 1:15 ""to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure."
474,"In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted."""
475,"Such a Conscience is no longer useful for discerning good from bad, right from wrong."
476,Therefore we become casualties in the war against evil.
477,But that is not what God desires for us.
478,"A person can either develop a good Conscience and keep it intact, or let it erode and be corrupted."
479,"A Conscience which has been eroded can be rebuilt, although with difficulty."
480,"Overall a Conscience is what the person has made it to be, which can sometimes be nothing at all."
481,"We now turn to the fifth and final component of the soul, the Emotion."
482,"It is an amazing gift from God which, when used properly, provides some of the highest levels of humanity we are capable of."
483,"That might come as a surprise, but this does not mean we do not have an Emotion in the soul, because we do have one."
484,In these instances it refers to the Emotion of the soul.
485,"At other times the Bible describes an emotional response, but does not use the word ""emotion."""
486,"(NOTE: When referring to the Emotion as a soul component it will be singular, since it is a single entity.)"
487,"Once again we see that the Emotion is a soul component, not a brain response."
488,"But we must distinguish the Emotion of the soul and its responses from certain brain or glandular chemical, hormonal and biological responses which have been confused with true emotion."
489,"The physical body can elicit certain types of feelings and urges which are not emotional, but might seem related."
490,"So to be as accurate as possible, because that is important, we must understand the difference between Emotion from the soul and glandular responses from the body."
491,"Common language often refers to emotional responses and feelings as coming from the ""Heart,"" but that is very misleading."
492,"We have already discussed the Heart of the soul, and it is the integrator and decision maker of the soul."
493,"But the Emotion can certainly drive decisions by the Heart, but not based on figuring out issues, since that function occurs in the Mind."
494,"Therefore the Heart is the final decision maker regarding when the Emotion can send its outputs from the soul, although at times the response is too great to control."
495,"Overall, the Emotion of the soul is designed by God to be the source of 47 responses and reactions to what is going on both inside and outside the soul."
496,"It expresses a range of such ""feelings,"" but we should be more precise than that."
497,"And some depend on the circumstances, such as laughter and crying, which can be either positive or negative depending on the reasons for each."
498,"While the Emotion certainly expresses negative feelings, it is not the source of mental sins most often blamed on the Emotion."
499,"Anger, hatred, jealously, revenge, and so on are not emotions, but rather are sins motivated by the Sinful Nature in association with the Emotion."
500,"This might seem like a fine point, but remember that we are discussing what the Bible says, and precision is important."
501,"To be even more precise, the ""feeling sins"" are not initiated in the Emotion, but rather in the Sinful Nature, therefore they are sins and not emotional responses, although the Emotion is involved."
502,"So these types of sins have an emotional component to them, but they are not formed in the Emotion of the soul."
503,The key to the issue is where they originate.
504,"No, they originate in the Sinful Nature, and the final decision to sin is made by the Heart, after accepting the inputs of the Sinful Nature which misuses the Emotion."
505,"Therefore the Emotion is an intermediary in the process, and is neither the instigator nor the actor."
506,"But when it aligns with the Sinful Nature, it takes part in a rebellion against the Heart and puts the soul into turmoil."
507,Legitimate emotional response is not connected to the Sinful Nature.
508,"But the Sinful Nature misuses the Emotion as its primary entree into soul processes, in order to get its way in the soul."
509,"When combined as allies, this duo can be a powerful driver in the soul, but not a positive one."
510,"But the Sinful Nature can also go through the Mind, which is the devious route since it results in conniving mischief using actual 48 thought."
511,It tries to bend the direction the soul is going.
512,"It seeks to create havoc, uncertainty, doubt, etc."
513,It opposes the human spirit.
514,"Emotion does not think, or remember, or make decisions, or have a Conscience, or care about the downside effects of what it does."
515,"Often in ways which may appear random, because it cannot think as the Mind does, since the Emotion is not a thinking part of the soul."
516,"And when the Sinful Nature is exerting control over the Emotion, the responses are illogical and detrimental to the proper function of the soul."
517,It explains why so many people cannot think at all.
518,"It explains so many of the dysfunctional things in life, especially why so many people cannot see the plain truth when it is right in front of them and completely obvious."
519,"They are not thinking about the issues involved, but rather they are emoting about them, often under the influence of the Sinful Nature."
520,This is where so many distortions in thinking and human belief systems occurs.
521,Rational thought is blocked by the Emotion when it is controlled by the Sinful Nature.
522,"An Emotion which is out of control revolts against the Heart and Mind, and puts the soul into a state of dysfunction."
523,It wants to be in charge of the soul but cannot handle authority.
524,"It cannot decide what to believe, so it does not believe anything, or flips back and forth."
525,"The ability to trust God, or to even believe God exists, can be lost."
526,"When the Heart and Mind try to reason with the Emotion which is out of control, the Emotion ignores reason and goes with its ""feelings."""
527,"There will be further 49 discussion of the Emotion related to its alliance with the Sinful Nature in later chapters, since it explains so many soul maladies and dysfunctions."
528,SINFUL NATURE The Sinful Nature is the add-on component of the soul which was acquired when the first humans sinned.
529,"While unbelievers have only a soul, and believers have both a soul and human spirit, all humans have this additional non-physical part of them which did not come from God."
530,"The Sinful Nature is attached to the soul, but not inside it or even an integral part of it."
531,"SOUL COMPONENT INTERACTIONS OVERVIEW Now that we have discussed the individual soul components, this section will provide an overview of how those soul components interact with each other."
532,"It is important to provide an overall understanding of how the soul works, then later chapters can provide more details regarding specifics about how the various components affect thoughts and beliefs."
533,"For instance, the Bible clearly distinguishes between the Heart and the Mind."
534,These show how the Heart and Mind are two separate components of the soul.
535,"As previously noted, the Heart of the person is the central processor of the soul and also the decision maker."
536,"At the same time the Heart receives inputs from the other soul advisors such as the Conscience, Emotion and others, and combines the knowledge and understanding from the Mind with inputs from the other parts of the soul, and also the human spirit in the case of believers."
537,The Sinful Nature also constantly tries to influence this process.
538,"And the Sinful Nature is another advisor, being a usurper advisor attached to the soul although not inside it, and is often a very powerful and influential advisor to the Heart."
539,"And if the person is a believer, the human spirit also advises the Heart of the soul, providing inputs of a spiritual nature based on what it has learned from the Bible, if anything."
540,"That is because the Sinful Nature is an ever-present force acting on the soul and in opposition to the human spirit, so it must be continually dealt with."
541,"Therefore we see how there is continual internal soul conflict whereby the Heart is pulled in different directions, on one hand by the Sinful Nature and on the other hand by the human spirit."
542,"1 Peter 2:11 says ""abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul."""
543,"Having a cunning and devious Sinful Nature which exerts its influences on the soul means we cannot stop all sinning, although we can control it to some degree when the human spirit is filled with spiritual information."
544,Therefore the Emotion of the soul should not get involved in most daily interactions inside the soul when decisions are being made.
545,"This is where much mischief inside the soul occurs, when the Sinful Nature enlists the Emotion as its ally to exert influence on the Mind and Heart."
546,"Therefore the Emotion is a ""wild card"" in the soul which can become overactive, and can exert undue influence over soul decisions."
547,"The result for a soul where the Emotion exerts too much influence will be illogical thinking, poor decision making, confusion, and eventually mental distortions."
548,These issues will be covered in more detail later.
549,"Before we move on, many of you have heard of something called a ""subconscious"" or ""subconscious mind."""
550,The person will not know these actions are being worked on until the results are presented by the Mind as an active thought or conclusion.
551,"But there is no separate subconscious mind as a component of the soul, since it is all part of the Mind and its ability to function on multiple levels at the same time, including background processing."
552,"Additionally, those thoughts which a person is trying to suppress are pushed down into this subconscious level, where thought does not result in immediate conclusions."
553,"The issue is ""I will think about that later."""
554,And that can be either legitimate or detrimental.
555,We will now take a more detailed look at the enemy within.
556,"Saying it is ""attached"" to the soul means the Sinful Nature is much like a barnacle on the hull of a ship, or a leach on a person."
557,It was not meant to be there.
558,God did not create it or design it.
559,"Rejecting God had enormous consequences not just for the original man and woman, but for all who would be descended from them."
560,"The long term effects of that one act of disobedience has been monumental, and will result in eternal misery for many."
561,"Therefore it was Adam who chose sin and gained a Sinful Nature for all humans, and that Sinful Nature was passed down through Adam to his offspring."
562,"The Sinful Nature is what tempts humans to disobey God, to revolt, to misbehave, to be arrogant, to disregard the normal functions of the soul and instead act irresponsibly."
563,And it is also the legacy of the revolt of Satan against God.
564,"When Satan sinned against God, and also the angels who joined him, each of them acquired a similar Sinful Nature at that point."
565,"So the Sinful Nature actually pre-dates humans, since it is an ancient legacy of the revolt of Satan."
566,"And Satan tempted the first humans into sin in order to pull them toward himself and away from God, therefore humans were lured through arrogance into accepting the Sinful Nature just as Satan had."
567,The Sinful Nature is what makes all who have it sin and disobey God in all the many ways creatures do so.
568,It is indeed the enemy within each of us.
569,"54 The fact that the soul is the source of so many negatives also proves that the Sinful Nature is attached to the soul, even though not inside the soul."
570,"The Sinful Nature is that part of the soul which Satan ""owns"" since he was the source of its creation at the fall of man."
571,"So the Sinful Nature is how Satan's Cosmic System influences people, and this is true whether it is a believer or unbeliever."
572,"Therefore human ""mental growth"" is less about brain development than soul development, since soul development is the only way to develop the logical advisors of the soul in a way which opposes the Sinful Nature's influences on the Heart of the soul."
573,"And illogical thinking and actions come from the soul, not from the human brain."
574,"The word ""sin"" in the singular and ""sinful"" are also used for the Sinful Nature, as well as several other terms."
575,"The following Bible verses refer to the Sinful Nature, and they are provided so the Reader can understand more about the Sinful Nature by reading through them without additional commentary."
576,"There are quite a few of them, but this is an important issue to understand since it is about the enemy of the soul."
577,"For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate."
578,"Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good."
579,"So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me."""
580,1 Cor.
581,1 Pet.
582,"Ephesians 2:3 ""Among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind."""
583,"Galatians 5:16 ""But I say, walk by the spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."""
584,"Ephesians 4:22 ""To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires"" Galatians 5:19-23 ""Now the works of the flesh are evident..."" Romans 8:3 ""For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do."""
585,"John 3:6 ""That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."""
586,"Romans 13:14 ""...make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."""
587,"Romans 8:3 ""For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit."""
588,"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God."""
589,We can see from the above verses that the Sinful Nature is discussed often in the Bible.
590,"With the Sinful Nature attached to the soul, it influences the person in multiple ways, all negative."
591,"The term ""base instincts"" applies to the low level conniving, arrogant, and immoral influences which are promoted from the Sinful Nature."
592,"Its primary path is to use the Emotion of the soul to influence the Mind and Heart, since the Emotion is a non-thinking responder to the Mind and Heart."
593,"Instead, the Sinful Nature peddles instinctive gratification of lust, arrogance, and other base desires, which entices the Emotion into a relationship with it, if the Heart is not diligent in preventing such an alliance."
594,Therefore the Sinful Nature works primarily through a system of arrogance and lusts.
595,"The arrogance part lures the person into thinking of themselves in vastly superior terms, far above reality."
596,"Arrogance therefore becomes a primary means of rejecting that which does not come from self, since only self matters, and only self is all-knowing."
597,"It may seem odd, but the Sinful Nature of each person has unique preferred sins and also non-preferred sins."
598,Each Sinful Nature is different.
599,"This is because certain types of sins do not line up with the particular lusts the individual prefers, which the Sinful Nature has acquired along the way."
600,"Whenever another person is regarded as a lesser human than self, the Sinful Nature is exercising its lust to be superior in its own view."
601,This often leads to sins of the tongue against another person.
602,"James 3:6 says ""The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body."
603,"It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell."""
604,"The reference to ""hell"" refers to the Sinful Nature as being a part of Satan's domain, since he is its originator."
605,"And most people have conflicting lusts since the Sinful Nature is not logical, but rather is instinctive."
606,"Recall that God did not give humans instincts to live by, but when humans sinned against God they chose instincts, which were introduced into the soul through the Sinful Nature."
607,These lusts are what makes humans instinctive and even animalistic although God did not design humans to function that way.
608,The Sinful Nature cannot act on its own and requires that the Heart validate its desires.
609,"At first this is not an easy task for the Sinful Nature, and treachery is required."
610,"If the Sinful Nature makes progress in getting its way, the process becomes much easier."
611,"The Heart cannot shift the blame to the other parts of the soul and say ""it wasn't me who did that"" when it gives in to the desires of the Sinful Nature."
612,"The Sinful Nature abuses this relationship between Heart and Emotion to its advantage, and presents its lusts first to the Emotion, and in turn the Emotion presents them to the Heart in the form of enticing emotional fulfillment."
613,"But the more the Heart gives in to the desires of the Sinful Nature, the easier it is for that Sinful Nature to have its desires approved by the Heart."
614,"When this happens, the Heart becomes hardened into a position of evil as it becomes instinctively predisposed to accept the desires of the Sinful Nature as the policy of the soul."
615,"Of course, it does not need to be that way."
616,The Heart can heed the advice of the Mind and its Conscience and reject the overtures of the Sinful Nature.
617,"And we will see that when the human spirit is filled with the Word of God, the human spirit can be the most powerful opponent of the Sinful Nature."
618,"Therefore the Sinful Nature is the enemy within, attached to our soul, working constantly to distract, derail, pull us in the wrong directions, cause emotional reactions against right actions, and lure us into revolting against the plan God has for our life."
619,"These mental sins become both inwardly destructive and also harmful toward others, including outward expressions as sins of the tongue."
620,"But for unbelievers it will remain part of them eternally, and will increase their torment."
621,When the Heart is primarily listening to and heeding the advice of the Sinful Nature the soul is working contrary to the design of God.
622,"The Sinful Nature is the ally of Satan, and allowing it to control the soul is a particularly disastrous state for believers."
623,As believers there is a constant war in our soul.
624,It is the battle of good versus evil.
625,"Our spiritual side, the human spirit, wars against the Sinful Nature, and vice versa."
626,"In most believers, unfortunately the Sinful Nature wins on a more regular basis."
627,"But for those who seek to please God during their time on earth, they will study the Word of God and fill their human spirit with spiritual learning, and will grow in the knowledge of God."
628,"As this growth continues, the believer has greater ability to resist the Sinful Nature and to fulfill the plan of God."
629,"They will not be perfect while alive on earth, and the Sinful Nature often gains certain advantages from time to time, but the key is to keep moving forward and continue growing in the Word in order to fill the human spirit with as much knowledge of truth as possible."
630,That is the primary purpose of the life of the believer after salvation.
631,"We believers remain on earth to grow spiritually, to live out of our human spirit which influences the soul to make the right choices, and to defeat the Sinful Nature in our daily walk through life."
632,"This is what allows us to love God, appreciate our Savior Jesus Christ, and generally to live as He wants us to live."
633,Then eternity is full of rewards for such a believer.
634,"For unbelievers, if they are controlled by the Sinful Nature they are in a state of revolt against the natural laws which God set in place for all humans to live by and under."
635,"They are still unsaved, but their life is generally ""normal"" and stable to a certain degree, even though apart from God."
636,"That is the gift God has given them while they are alive, respecting their choice to refuse salvation."
637,"But for the unbeliever the Sinful Nature will be a secondary source of soul pain during eternity, along with the intense physical pain."
638,"And speaking of the human spirit, it is finally time to take a more detailed look at this component of the inner human which is only found in believers."
639,It is what makes humans a spiritual being capable of interfacing with God.
640,"60 CHAPTER 7 THE HUMAN SPIRIT The human spirit is probably the least understood component of the inner human, even though the Bible reveals many fascinating things about it."
641,"We will now discuss what it is, what it does, and why we need one."
642,"The short version is that humans cannot interact with God without it, since it makes us spiritually alive."
643,And without it humans are spiritually dead.
644,"The previous chapters have mostly discussed the soul, but believers have two parts to their immaterial being, both a soul and human spirit, which are separate but connected."
645,"The human spirit and soul are differentiated as two separate parts of the inner human in both the Old Testament and New Testament since there are different words for each in both original languages of the Bible (Old Testament Hebrew: nephesh and ruach, New Testament Greek: psuche and pneuma, for soul and spirit respectively)."
646,"As a result of the original sin of Adam his descendants are born without a human spirit, however Jesus Christ was the exception."
647,"A human spirit is gained at salvation, so unbelievers have only a soul without a human spirit, since the human spirit is the product of spiritual regeneration at the point of salvation."
648,"This is why salvation must be a gift from God, not something to be earned over time, since no unbeliever can please God in any way or earn anything because they lack a human spirit and therefore are not spiritual beings."
649,"And the human spirit is given all at once, not gradually over time."
650,"Only God can make humans into spiritual beings at the point of faith in Jesus Christ as Savior, not as a result of anything the person does to try to earn it, since salvation cannot be earned or deserved."
651,"At the moment of belief in Christ the human spirit becomes regenerated, and that is the event which makes us a spiritual being and 61 locks in our eternal salvation."
652,Forever.
653,"Once it is regenerated, the human spirit can never again be lost by sin."
654,"1 Thessalonians 5:23 says: ""May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."""
655,"The human spirit is not the same as the Holy Spirit indwelling and mentoring the believer, but rather it is a second portion of the immaterial life of the believer, and although it is interconnected with the soul it is entirely separate."
656,Therefore we understand that the soul is primarily the humanity part of the believer which enables interaction with God's creation while the human spirit is the spiritual part of the believer which enables interaction with God.
657,"Unlike learning math or physics or a hobby, the Word has spiritual power in and of itself, which can only be harnessed if it resides in the human spirit where the Holy Spirit indwells."
658,"But knowledge puffs up while love builds up."""
659,Therefore it is learning the Word and growing by it which gives us power from God to live a life focused on God's plan for us.
660,"Only spirit can interact with Spirit, so it is our human spirit which interacts with God."
661,"However, the human spirit must use the soul to reach God, so these two parts of the inner human are required to act in unison."
662,"We must pray and worship and apply spiritual truths out from our human spirit, which in turn uses the Heart of the soul to reach God."
663,"And the Holy Spirit indwells our human spirit, not our soul, so when a believer is living the spiritual life that person is living out of their human spirit, the location of both the Holy Spirit and spiritual 62 truth from the Word."
664,"The human spirit filled with truth must therefore direct the soul, so that we do not live from the soul alone."
665,The human spirit is therefore necessary to understand spiritual information and to have interaction with God.
666,"The focal point for interaction between God and humans is the human spirit, since only spirit can interact with Spirit."
667,"So the most an unbeliever can have are soul thoughts about God in a general sense, but they are not spiritual thoughts, since that requires a human spirit."
668,"And they cannot understand God in any meaningful way or understand His spiritual truth, because as 1 Corinthians 2:14 says ""The person without the spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the spirit."""
669,As such they can have no interaction with God.
670,"If they want to become a spiritual being, they must first accept the salvation offered by God through belief in Jesus Christ, at which point God gives that person a human spirit."
671,"Note that it is a belief which saves us, which is the subject of this book."
672,Beliefs are powerful things.
673,Once again the Bible provides the answers.
674,"We have seen that Hebrews 4:12 says: ""For the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow."""
675,"The ""joints and marrow"" reference is instructive regarding how the two are separate but work together, and also how they are designed."
676,"Note the word order in the verse above is ""soul and spirit, joints and marrow"" setting up the analogy with the soul analogous to the joints, and the human 63 spirit analogous to the marrow."
677,"The specific sections of the body in view are the hip and shoulder joints, which are the major joints of the body which affect mobility."
678,"Joint is not marrow, and marrow is not joint."
679,One is bone and the other is a spongy blood- making tissue.
680,"While there is also marrow inside the pelvis, sternum, and a few other locations, these are not ""joints"" as in this analogy."
681,"And it is the red marrow which makes the blood cells which flow throughout our bodies, giving it sustenance, delivering oxygen, and providing immune protection."
682,This would indicate that the human spirit is fully contained inside the soul just like the marrow is located fully inside the joint bones.
683,"Recall that humans are born with only a soul, but not a human spirit, so there is an ""empty space"" where the human spirit is later inserted if the person becomes a believer and is regenerated, meaning the human spirit is put in place into a specific space designed for it inside the soul."
684,"Without this analogy from the Bible we would have assumed the soul and human spirit were completely separated, and only connected at a single interface, somewhat like a dumbbell connected by a bar or two balloons tied together."
685,"Instead, the Bible shows the human spirit fully inside the soul, but still separate and distinct in a separate chamber designed to hold it."
686,64 Adam and Eve were created with both a soul and human spirit.
687,And their souls were created as male and female as well as their bodies.
688,"And this was before the woman Eve had been formed out from the DNA of Adam, so it is discussing the creation of the soul and human spirit."
689,"This passage in Genesis therefore refers to the inner human as the image of God, not the body, when male and female are mentioned as being created."
690,"When these two eventually sinned by eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the one forbidden tree, their human spirits are what died, but not their souls or bodies."
691,"This is what defines spiritual death, that the human spirit is dead and the person only has a soul."
692,"They remained physically alive after sinning, so it did not mean physical death."
693,"Again, this shows the importance God places on beliefs."
694,"Then God offered salvation which they both accepted, and at that point their human spirits were revived."
695,"But as a result of their original sin, the descendants of Adam and Eve are born without a human spirit, and salvation is required to obtain one by regeneration."
696,Therefore all people are born with a soul but no human spirit.
697,"The only exception was Jesus Christ who was born perfect with both a soul and a human spirit (spiritually alive) therefore He did not need salvation, which made Him qualified to be the Savior."
698,"At the moment of faith in Jesus Christ (and during the Old Testament by faith in the promised Messiah) the human spirit is revived, and from that time on the person is spiritually alive with both a soul and a human spirit forever."
699,Angels also have soul and spirit components.
700,"This does not refer to the bodies of angels, who are often called ""spirits,"" which is a physical issue."
701,"Elect angels have both soul and spirit, while Satan and fallen angels have only a soul without a spirit since they lost it when they 65 sinned and revolted against God."
702,"This separates God's elect angels from Satan and his fallen angels, just as humans are separated by the same issue."
703,Therefore fallen angels have no ability to have a spiritual relationship with God.
704,"Angels have the exact same soul (and spirit for elect angels) as humans, just in a different type of body."
705,"That is because mankind was created to resolve the conflict between God and Satan, and the only fair way to do it was by having the exact same immaterial components in both humans and angels, although in very different bodies."
706,"Therefore a spiritual life is only possible through use of the human spirit, which has four main purposes: 1) First, it makes the person spiritually alive and therefore enables interaction with God, since only spirit can interact with Spirit."
707,The soul cannot express spiritual thoughts apart from the human spirit.
708,And the human spirit relies on the soul to deliver its outputs toward God.
709,"This builds up our faith through an understanding of God, which builds trust and love."
710,"3) Thirdly, the human spirit makes spiritual information from the Word of God understandable."
711,"No person can truly and deeply understand spiritual information apart from the human spirit but ""considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them."""
712,For this purpose the human spirit has its own memory designed for spiritual information only.
713,The human soul cannot store spiritual information since it is not designed to do so.
714,"4) Finally, the human spirit is the source of spiritual direction to the Heart and Mind of the soul."
715,"Not perfectly, just greatly enhanced because the human spirit gets its power from the Word and from the Holy Spirit."
716,"66 As mentioned, the human spirit cannot directly interface with God or the outside world, but must go through the Heart and Mind of the soul."
717,"The spiritual information in the human spirit can be accessed by the Mind and used by the Heart, and that is the interface between soul and spirit, namely that the Heart and Mind of the soul access the spiritual information which resides in the human spirit and apply it to provide a life of spiritual impact."
718,Which brings up the point that the human spirit has sub-components just as the soul does.
719,"The human spirit has a Mind as well, which processes the spiritual information received into the human spirit and stores it in the Memory of the human spirit."
720,"So the human spirit's Mind and Memory are necessary to process and store spiritual information inside the human spirit, which is aided by the Holy Spirit who indwells the human spirit."
721,"While the human spirit is focused on the spiritual, the human soul is the center of human life and interfaces with the material world."
722,Therefore the believer can interface with God because the soul is supported by the human spirit.
723,"This is important to understand, that the human spirit must be present in order for God to recognize the right of a soul to interact spiritually with Him."
724,"This is what the Bible means when it says the Word of God is ""alive and powerful."""
725,"This further shows how spiritual thoughts originate in the human spirit and flow out of the soul through the Heart toward God and people, and spiritual learning flows back into the human spirit through the Heart and Mind."
726,"The Heart decides whether to allow information to enter the soul and human spirit, and can either accept or reject it, so the Heart acts as the gatekeeper of information for both the soul and human spirit."
727,"In all of this the Heart is not 67 just passing everything through, but rather the Heart decides what gets through."
728,It will also be prevented from getting spiritual information out through the Heart.
729,The result is a dysfunctional spiritual life because the human spirit is shut down by the Heart.
730,"The human spirit of the believer is empty at salvation when it is regenerated, and also in the believer who has never grown spiritually."
731,"If the soul goes to the human spirit for spiritual information but finds little or nothing there since it is empty or nearly so, there can be little or no spiritual expression by the Heart."
732,"This is why studying the Word of God is so crucial, because it is the basis of spiritual growth and puts information into the human spirit which can be accessed and used by the soul, and also by the Holy Spirit."
733,"1 Peter 2:2 says ""Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation."""
734,"Salvation gives us eternal life, but then filling up the human spirit with Bible truth is required to give us spiritual power with which to think and form beliefs consistent with the Word of God."
735,Only then can our spirit-soul processes function in alignment with God's plan for our lives.
736,Spiritual information must be stored and structurally assembled inside the human spirit with the mentoring of the Holy Spirit in order to have the power God designed His Word to have in us.
737,The Holy Spirit turns information learned from studying the Bible into a spiritually powerful form which is then usable to empower the spiritual life.
738,"But this does not occur all at once, and requires a long term commitment to the study of the Word of God."
739,"For new believers who know very little spiritual information at first, there is not much that can be applied to the life."
740,"Not perfectly, and not all at once."
741,"It takes time and persistence in learning the Word, which is our spiritual food for spiritual 68 energy."
742,Therefore believers must grow up spiritually by building up spiritual information inside the human spirit.
743,"The process is slow and requires continual learning and applying of God's Word to the life, first small issues and tests, then becoming real faith as the believer reaches higher and higher levels of spiritual maturity."
744,"Indeed, you are still not ready."""
745,"The Holy Spirit helps us by ensuring we can understand the spiritual information we learn by putting it into a usable form inside the human spirit where it is stored, categorized, and turned into an interlocking web of spiritual truth which becomes increasingly usable in our lives."
746,"This enables the believer to put to use the power of the Word from the human spirit through the soul, all with the help of the Holy Spirit."
747,"As the believer matures spiritually, the human spirit becomes the dominant influencer of the inner human, and that believer starts living life out from the human spirit rather than merely out of the soul as unbelievers live."
748,"Without maximum spiritual information in the human spirit the believer attempts to live the spiritual life out of the soul rather than the human spirit, which fails to please God."
749,"Soul Memory can store facts about God and His plan, but that is not spiritual information since it is only in the soul, therefore it is purely informational."
750,Only the human spirit stores spiritual information which is usable in a spiritual form.
751,"That is because the Holy Spirit works within the human spirit, where He indwells, to make the Word of God into spiritual understanding and wisdom."
752,"The more advanced the understanding of spiritual information, the greater the spiritual power."
753,"There is a difference between simply knowing something from the Bible in the soul and truly understanding and believing it in the human spirit, where it has 69 spiritual power with the help of the Holy Spirit."
754,"On the contrary, repay evil with blessing"" but then not be able to truly apply that verse to their life because it only resides in the soul, and is not embedded as spiritual information inside the human spirit."
755,"This is spiritual growth, the build-up of spiritual information into a spiritual form and format which becomes more and more an integral part of the life of that believer."
756,"Hebrews 6:19 says about the human spirit filled with the Word of God: ""We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure."
757,"It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain."""
758,"The human spirit is the ""inner sanctuary"" comparing the layout of the Temple of Israel, whereby the human spirit is analogous to the Holy of Holies which housed the presence of God."
759,"So the soul of the believer is like the outer areas of the Temple where interaction with the outside world occurred, and the human spirit is like the Holy of Holies where personal interaction and communion with God occurred."
760,They are 70 spiritually dead to God.
761,"They require salvation and activation of a human spirit before God will have anything to do with them, or take notice of anything they do which is moral, nice, useful, helpful, and on and on."
762,Therefore God cannot help them if they will not simply believe and accept the only Savior.
763,We will next discuss beliefs.
764,"Beliefs are developed from our thoughts, and set the policies for the soul."
765,"Our beliefs drive the interpretation of what our senses feed into our soul, and also what we will think in response to those inputs from the outside world."
766,Thoughts and beliefs.
767,They define the real human.
768,"Now we are at the point where we can discuss what thoughts and thinking are, and how thoughts and thinking become beliefs."
769,Thinking does not necessarily result in beliefs.
770,"And thoughts are not always thinking, and thinking does not necessarily result in cogent thoughts."
771,"Beliefs are acceptance of the validity of someone, something, or some concept."
772,"When a person forms a belief, it sets a policy which guides the soul's future thinking."
773,"Therefore beliefs set boundaries for future decisions about the world around us, spiritual issues, and anything which becomes important to us."
774,Beliefs drive and motivate people to action.
775,And belief is what God requires of humans if they are to have eternal salvation.
776,"That issue alone makes beliefs the most important issue in life, because it determines our eternal status."
777,We need to first examine how beliefs are formed.
778,"Then we will see how most lower level beliefs are driven by the higher level beliefs, called core beliefs."
779,"After that is understood, we will look at the issue of internal soul distortions as related to beliefs."
780,"We are getting into some very weighty territory, so let us start by examining how humans know anything at all, how they learn, and therefore how core beliefs are developed."
781,"That could require a separate book, so we will only summarize the issues here."
782,"There are variations of each, and we are not trying to be all inclusive."
783,"We will look at each of these basic methods of learning, and how they affect beliefs."
784,Therefore most of the data and information which enters the soul comes in empirically through the senses and the brain.
785,But the senses teach very little about what is behind the things sensed.
786,"For instance, were the things around us created by God or was it all just an accident of nature?"
787,The senses cannot provide an answer.
788,They just show us what is around us.
789,"When it comes to the type of learning which has the most impact on core beliefs, the majority comes from accepting information presented by others, namely by faith."
790,"Faith is not limited to religion, not even close to it."
791,"Schools are a faith-based method of learning, with an occasional lab for demonstrations to the senses."
792,"When it comes to believing information by faith, the hazard is in the accuracy, or lack thereof, of the messenger."
793,"Of course, the results are not always actually ""true,"" which is the hazard of this type of learning process."
794,It is what Albert Einstein and other great thinkers were famous for doing.
795,"Then one must ask why that information is accurate, and Einstein was often inaccurate as was later learned."
796,"Therefore humans develop core beliefs in different ways, but mainly through faith."
797,"Those core beliefs may be true, partially true, or false, usually based on the source of the information, and whether it was accurate or not."
798,"For those who form a core belief based on the Bible and being a believer, they may use the Bible as their ultimate source of truth when it comes to core beliefs."
799,Those who reject religion tend to gravitate toward an eclectic belief system which has some other source of meaning other than God or a god.
800,"For some it is family, work, making money, friendships, helping others, hobbies and interests, pleasure seeking, or a mix of some or all of these."
801,"Most people try to find some meaning in life, some reason for their existence."
802,"But some think only about self, which leads to distorted beliefs about one's own importance relative to others."
803,"Although it is an inaccurate approach, it is the one used most often by humans."
804,"We have seen how core beliefs are firmly held views about important things which in turn drive how we think about the world, God, the divine order on earth, and anything important to us."
805,This is where the human soul and spirit come into play.
806,"As noted previously, the human soul is imparted at birth, but is empty of information."
807,"If the person eventually becomes a believer, the human spirit is regenerated at that point, and it is also empty and requires filling."
808,"This in turn drives how a person perceives the world and all subsequent information they receive, and also what they care about."
809,"These build up norms and standards in the Conscience of the soul, which are then used to evaluate and judge things to be good or bad, moral or immoral."
810,"Beliefs related to most issues are centered in the Heart of the soul, except that the human spirit contains Biblical spiritual beliefs."
811,"For non-spiritual beliefs the entire soul is involved in developing them, especially core beliefs, then they ultimately reside in the Heart."
812,And the human spirit develops spiritual beliefs with assistance from the soul.
813,"Therefore this ""logical"" component of the soul can be entirely illogical, and the beliefs which come from the Mind and its thinking process can also be illogical and wrong."
814,"They seek to find a belief system which will establish them as adults, sometimes when they are not prepared to do so."
815,"At this point rebellion in the soul can upset fragile beliefs, but they are not necessarily replaced right away."
816,"Or if they are, the process is often not logical or well considered."
817,"But some just need time to sort it all out, and maybe a few hard knocks to wake them up."
818,"If they can learn Bible truths early and stick with them through these teen years, they are most likely to make it through with minimal damage."
819,"If not, the results are more random."
820,"There are two general methods of corroborating what we have learned and believe to be true, and both are established by God."
821,"There is common sense, which lines up with what the universe reveals to us, and there is absolute truth, which is revealed by God in the Bible."
822,"God designed the universe to reveal to people the proper way to live, even for unbelievers."
823,"The universe provides feedback loops to encourage and discourage certain types of behaviors, shows what works over and over again, and what does not work."
824,"Some things have good outcomes, and some things bad outcomes."
825,"Of course there are random outcomes and unfairness, but generally people learn that certain types of behaviors repeat with certain types of outcomes."
826,"If we grow in the Word the Holy Spirit provides a spiritual feedback loop which demonstrates to us that our faith was correctly placed in the Word, and our faith is justified to us over time."
827,"Therefore common sense and the Word of God both serve to keep us in line with reality and truth, if we choose to center our belief systems on them."
828,"However, the origin of the universe and many things related to God are not provable because God does not want them to be provable, since He requires us to live by faith, not by sight."
829,"It is often a fanatical core belief for them, because they fear the alternative if they are wrong."
830,"However they change their unproven theories constantly, basing core beliefs on a set of ever changing theories which are unprovable."
831,"Additionally, the lines between scientific proof and computer models have become blurred in order to declare something scientifically proven, when the outcome of models is by definition not proof, but is based on variable assumptions fed into the models by fallible and biased humans using limited information."
832,"If the researcher knew enough to fully feed a model, then the model would not be needed since the issue would be self-proving."
833,People who reject God and the Bible must by definition accept something else to believe in.
834,"By any definition that is a succession of miracles, making such a belief system a religion."
835,"So unbelievers do believe in miracles after all, since the probability of this happening has been calculated as being zero."
836,Literally zero over infinity.
837,"Therefore science is a god to them, and the primary statement of their faith is that given enough time anything is possible."
838,"Oddly, this does not dissuade most of them from their belief systems, even though the truth from God's Word is much easier to believe since it makes much more sense."
839,"The universe itself is testimony to the existence of God and to what the Bible reveals, and these things support our faith."
840,Therefore the faith of believers is far more logical than the faith of unbelievers.
841,"Our faith is not blind, but the faith of unbelievers in what they believe is truly blind and even foolishness."
842,"Recall how the soul components interact like a committee to ""figure out"" or ""ponder"" an issue brought in by the senses, or by a question internal to the soul."
843,"That is the thinking process, which consists of thoughts searching for a conclusion."
844,"We have seen how the Mind of the soul is the overall engine of thinking, and thoughts are the sub-components of thinking."
845,"Existing beliefs in the Heart are used as guidelines and policies, which often sets the boundaries on the thinking process."
846,"The Mind, Conscience, and Memory may have inputs which form new thoughts and more thinking."
847,"When the Mind has a final work product about the issue, it is presented to the Heart for review and consideration."
848,"The Heart will then review the work product of the Mind and either approve it, reject it, or send it back for additional consideration."
849,"That entire process is called ""thinking."""
850,"While the person is engaged in thinking about the issue, such thinking can be all over the place, from mere musings to scientific and mathematical evaluations."
851,"If the subject being considered requires an acceptance about an important matter, when the Heart makes a final decision on acceptability, a new belief can be formed by that acceptance."
852,"The primary location for beliefs is the Heart, and if related to determining good vs. bad then also in the Conscience."
853,But the entire soul will also be affected by a belief.
854,"So it is acceptance by the Heart which turns the thoughts and thinking process into a belief, and an overall belief system is built up over time."
855,"The most important high level beliefs form the core belief system, those beliefs a person holds to most firmly."
856,"So the most powerful part of one's belief system are the core beliefs, those which we hold to tightly, deeply, and tenaciously."
857,"Core beliefs can be many things, which depends on the individual."
858,"Religion is a major core belief, if one is accepted and believed."
859,Most Christians make it their most significant core belief.
860,So also for people who believe in other religions.
861,"There are, of course, those who generally accept a religion but then live as though it is unimportant, or pick and choose what parts are accepted, so there are certainly exceptions."
862,"But in general, beliefs which oppose a deeply held core religious belief will usually be quickly rejected and disbelieved."
863,Those which support it will likely be readily accepted.
864,"This shows how core beliefs can drive what is possible to believe in the future, setting boundaries of acceptability."
865,"Of course, this can work for good or bad in the life."
866,"Most decisions by the Heart do not form new beliefs, but rather are routine decisions about many mundane issues."
867,"These may be low level beliefs, which most are, or those of moderate importance, or the few higher order core beliefs."
868,"The higher the belief in the order of importance in the soul, the more strongly it influences the thinking process."
869,The key to beliefs is that a decision by the Heart on a key or foundational issue forms a new policy for the soul to live by.
870,Acceptance means the Heart has approved the 78 issue as the policy of the soul.
871,"Decisions about a belief set a precedent for future thoughts and thinking, which continues unless that belief is overturned by new thinking on the matter."
872,"We will use a fairly routine, although important, decision process related to needing a new automobile."
873,"The question is posed internally to the soul, and maybe among others, should we buy a new vehicle, and what would we buy?"
874,"The question in the soul initiates a thinking process about a new vehicle, and this process will require new data and information which the soul does not already possess."
875,"Advertising, automotive reviews, cost comparisons, Uncle Frank, and other data sources provide inputs."
876,"As the data is retrieved by the brain, this data goes to the Mind, since it is what figures things out in the soul."
877,"Photos are reviewed, and reports are read about customer satisfaction."
878,"Uncle Frank's inputs are dismissed, since he drives an old beat-up land yacht."
879,"Memory rules out the brand owned decades ago where the engine quit after only 25,000 miles."
880,"The sensory data is turned into information in the soul, and more data and information are needed and obtained over the ensuing weeks."
881,Then the Mind presents the best options to the Heart for a decision.
882,"The Heart requests inputs from others involved, especially the spouse."
883,The options are considered internally to the soul.
884,The spouse wants a black one.
885,An impasse occurs.
886,It is discovered the red one costs more.
887,The black one becomes more attractive to both.
888,The semi-final product is sent to the Heart.
889,Costs are reviewed again.
890,It is available at the local dealer.
891,The vehicle purchase is made.
892,"But which parts were the thoughts, thinking, and beliefs?"
893,This started a thinking process about buying a new vehicle.
894,This would become a serious issue due to its cost and long term commitment.
895,"There were numerous variables, some of them in conflict."
896,"Cost conflicted with desired options, so cost-benefit analyses needed to be performed."
897,New thoughts are introduced along the way.
898,"Maybe an electric car, hybrid, body styles, and other potential choices are considered."
899,"Thoughts and thinking go hand in hand, as one begets the other in a circular process."
900,"Thoughts are about specific issues, and thinking is the process of considering all the thoughts, which also forms new thoughts which might include interim conclusions on some of the issues."
901,One might be that the budget must not exceed a certain amount.
902,That becomes a belief which forms a parameter.
903,Parameters limit options and set boundaries.
904,Acceptance of that final thought by a decision turns it into a belief regarding what is best for the family.
905,So that is finally put to rest.
906,On to the next issue.
907,The two kids are nearing college age.
908,"And on it goes in the soul, which never gets a rest from thoughts, thinking, and decisions about what to believe."
909,"Granted, this is a description of how lower and mid-level beliefs are used when thoughts and thinking occur regarding an important, but not life altering, issue."
910,"80 Salvation belief is an example of a dramatic shift in core beliefs, and the most important one a person can make."
911,"If it is not immediately rejected, usually due to an existing and conflicting belief system, the Mind will begin a thinking process to determine if it should be accepted."
912,"That process can be rather short or occur over a long period of time, as the issue is thought about at certain times, maybe when someone close to them dies."
913,But there is a difference with the gospel.
914,"The Holy Spirit becomes involved and helps the unbeliever with the thought and thinking process by making the salvation message clear, bringing them to the point of belief, or no belief."
915,Thoughts and beliefs about many other issues may interfere.
916,"So the person must make a decision about salvation, whether to accept it (belief) or reject it outright, or by delay, saying ""I'll think about that later."""
917,And failure to make a decision is itself a decision.
918,"If salvation by faith in Christ is never accepted, then it is rejected by default, and the consequences are the same as an outright rejection."
919,"Not thoughts about Him, and not thinking about Him."
920,But rather belief in Him.
921,"Belief is acceptance, while thoughts and thinking can simply be musings about the issue with no real conclusion or acceptance."
922,Thoughts about salvation do not save a person.
923,Thinking about how Jesus Christ was a real person who did some good deeds long ago and was executed on a cross does not save a person.
924,"Only a belief, which is acceptance, that Jesus Christ is one's Savior, can be used by the Holy Spirit to lock in eternal salvation."
925,Thoughts and thinking about Jesus Christ must result in a decision to believe in Christ as Savior to make salvation a reality.
926,"It is the belief which saves, not the thoughts or thinking process."
927,It is our beliefs which matter.
928,"For every human who ever exists, this one decision about a single belief is the most important one they will make in life."
929,"It is a free gift from God, because He did all the work, and He offers it to all humans since we are helpless to save ourselves."
930,"But it must be accepted, meaning believed, since belief is acceptance."
931,"""Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved."""
932,"(Acts 16:31) ""For it is by grace you are saved through faith."""
933,"At the moment of belief the human spirit becomes regenerated, and that is the event which makes us a spiritual being and locks in our eternal salvation."
934,Forever.
935,We can see that salvation by faith alone is not as simple as it might seem.
936,He has made it the only way.
937,"Each person must make this decision, and that single belief or lack of belief will determine the eternal status of every human who ever lives."
938,"There are, of course, answers from the Bible."
939,"Some people do the complete opposite of what most would do when forming beliefs, and some will set aside portions of an overall belief system easily when it is convenient."
940,And some people say they believe one thing and do the opposite.
941,"So belief systems can be all over the map, and wildly different from one person to the next."
942,"Due to the ""irrationality factor"" involved, overall generalities will be explained, but belief systems cannot be forced into a mold."
943,"Everyone is different, and no two people have the exact same belief system."
944,"Therefore, having a core belief does not mean a person will comply with the entire belief system as outlined from top to bottom."
945,"Part of this is due to the various ways people arrive at their belief systems, which can often be random and undisciplined."
946,"Given the importance of beliefs aligning with reality, that would seem to be a bad idea."
947,And it is.
948,"Beliefs can either align with reality and truth, or try to defy them, or fall somewhere in between."
949,"Belief systems are best developed during childhood, and then re-tested after the person begins thinking as an adult."
950,"Parental teaching must now compete with more conflicting data, inputs, and information than ever before."
951,Therefore confusion among children has become intensified.
952,"And there is a right track, and there are wrong tracks, as defined by truth and reality vs. untruth and unreality."
953,"The world tries to deny this and restate the premise as there is no truth, so reality is what anyone thinks it is."
954,"A few examples would be useful, just for illustration to make a point."
955,Think of the ancient world where the earth was believed to be flat.
956,"Idolatry was also widespread, whereby most people worshiped statues make by human hands."
957,"Now idolatry is more sophisticated, but still based on falsehood."
958,"Many forms of magic and superstitions have been believed, and still are."
959,"There have been many forms of mysticism throughout history, which are generally beliefs in the powers of an outside force, but not from the true God."
960,"Numerous false religions have existed and still exist, with many followers."
961,"Alien abductions and crop circles, anyone?"
962,"Vampires, ghosts, zombies?"
963,"Of course, some of these are not actual beliefs but rather exaggerated stories, or fiction, even though untrue."
964,"Sometimes an untrue belief is just having fun or using the imagination, so as long as they do not become high level beliefs they have little effect."
965,"The fact is many beliefs held by people are patently untrue, and often bizarre."
966,"And this is the real problem, when untrue beliefs stand in the way of believing truth and facing reality when it is important."
967,Therefore some false beliefs can lead to a miserable life and even a miserable eternity.
968,"For instance, if someone believes chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla ice cream, then that is a matter of personal preference which does not generally affect others, either in a positive or negative way."
969,"One might think preferences among pickup trucks is also something irrelevant, but to some it is akin to a religious choice, so to them it is more than a choice among equally useful options."
970,"Showing preference of some product over another is still a belief, and it is that person's choice to make."
971,"However, the point is that a belief system is what the individual decides it should be, and the components are very personal, even if the belief system is foolish, detrimental, silly, ridiculous, shortsighted, or just plain wrong."
972,"There are many such beliefs out there, often based on low evidence inputs, hunches and intuition, and are therefore highly variable in quality."
973,But not all are important.
974,Sometimes a belief is just a way to set up a personal identity.
975,"After all, a person is defined by their beliefs."
976,"However, some beliefs matter a lot."
977,"This would be a failure of the core beliefs of such a believer, at least in that area."
978,"Such a belief would provide no motivation to seek to change the beliefs of the unbeliever, since it would apparently not matter."
979,Sometimes we just get less than we had expected.
980,Other times we avoid a core duty of being a believer.
981,"For the unbeliever, their belief system has eternal repercussions."
982,"If they are close to us, we want them to be happy and successful, and we may think they can achieve such things if they believe as we do."
983,"Or we may come into conflict with others, or be affected by their decisions, and we do not like what they believe because it is opposed to our beliefs."
984,"So if a person believes they deserve to have your property more than you do, and act on that belief, that brings about direct conflict and violates the right to own property."
985,Then we care about their beliefs.
986,"Christians want to affect the belief system of those who do not believe as they do, because they want all people to have eternal salvation and live a life which glorifies God."
987,"On the other hand, those who believe in 85 radical causes may want to suppress the rights of others who just want to live as they choose."
988,There are many reasons why the various belief systems in the world cause friction and disagreement.
989,"And that is the ultimate issue with belief systems, namely that it results in polarization."
990,Beliefs separate people.
991,They drive people apart.
992,"Jesus said ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth."
993,"I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."""
994,"Please do not misunderstand, polarization can be good or bad."
995,"Toleration is one thing, but actual acceptance joins with them in their beliefs."
996,"It will not be a surprise that if two people disagree about their core beliefs then there is a lack of harmony, and even friction between them, leading to polarization."
997,Core beliefs are very powerful things.
998,"And if the belief system is criminal, terroristic, and otherwise harmful to innocent people, it becomes necessary to isolate them, and the Bible supports that view."
999,An empty shell.
1000,Let us proceed to unravel that issue in more detail.
1001,"86 Core belief systems, the ones we really care about, can be very generally separated into two overall categories."
1002,"We could add a third which would be indifference about everything, but that is not much of a belief system, but rather the avoidance of beliefs."
1003,"Moral judgments would not be possible, and would be a joke."
1004,"Nothing would be out-of-bounds, criminal, or immoral."
1005,Nothing would be right or wrong.
1006,"In essence, there would be no principles to live by since they assume there is a difference between right and wrong, good and evil, compassion and intolerance."
1007,"Without God there would therefore be no principles of right and wrong, only self-benefit at any and all cost to others."
1008,"Others do not matter, only self matters."
1009,Eat or be eaten.
1010,Kill or be killed.
1011,"Those are ""principles"" of animals, and also humans who act like animals."
1012,"But wait, evolutionists believe humans are animals, so let us briefly examine what they would say about this issue."
1013,This is where evolutionists reveal their true self.
1014,"They are survivalists, and have no belief system apart from what an animal has, which is self-preservation."
1015,Interesting.
1016,"But alas, the evolutionists show they have no sense of anything moral or decent or good or of a higher purpose."
1017,That is illogical.
1018,"But the god ""Time"" overcomes logic."
1019,"And the 87 future will yield -- only more grinding up of the next set of species, including humans."
1020,"In this view people are animals, so they have no moral purpose in life except to be used to enhance future, stronger life-forms."
1021,But no other purpose.
1022,And an evil one.
1023,"The evolutionists do not believe in the soul, so killing off those ""human animals"" who are weaker is a moral imperative."
1024,"It is what their god ""Time"" demands as a sacrifice."
1025,A human sacrifice.
1026,"Which by contrast, brings us back to God and His beliefs."
1027,And His love.
1028,"God gives purpose to human life, and imparts high goals and moral achievements into the picture."
1029,"The point is that God is the source of belief systems which have meaning and purpose, morals and nobility of character, and good which opposes evil."
1030,"Apart from Him there would be only one belief system, which is not a belief, but rather the only available option -- survival."
1031,"But the Bible declares there is truth, and also that there is non-truth and/or lies, and that there is right and wrong."
1032,Note the emphasis on thinking.
1033,"""It"" is not all relative."
1034,"There is truth, and there are lies."
1035,"John 8:44 says ""You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires."
1036,"He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him."
1037,"When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."""
1038,Pretty clear.
1039,And a mixture of partial truth and some lies is also a lie.
1040,"But unbelievers do not have access to absolute truth since it is only discerned by the human spirit using information from the Word of God, and they have neither a human spirit nor spiritual access to the Word."
1041,"Instead, God provided humans with an overall belief system as outlined in His Word."
1042,"As you might suspect, those beliefs which do not align with what God has provided in the Bible are said to be wrong, incorrect, and even evil."
1043,"It seems that God is fairly adamant about His set of norms and standards for humans, and that He has a belief system which humans must align with, rather than vice versa."
1044,"But as we look around we quickly find that beliefs among humans are quite variable, and often do not line up with what God has revealed."
1045,"In fact, humans try over and over to act as if God does not have the right to decide what is right and what is wrong."
1046,"which beliefs are correct vs. incorrect, then it is certainly God."
1047,"And He gets to decide for all people, including those who do not believe in Him."
1048,And it is love which ultimately separates God and His plan from a godless evolution- based belief system and its lack of any useful purpose.
1049,"And by the way, the only religion based on a loving God is Christianity."
1050,The only one.
1051,"But of course, it does not work that way."
1052,"This will not surprise you, but you want to know why it is true."
1053,"Only the Bible reveals that to us, so we will now drill down even further and explore and describe what the Bible says about variations in human thoughts and beliefs."
1054,"Having recently discussed the Sinful Nature, you likely already suspect it is somehow involved."
1055,You are correct.
1056,"At the core of the issue of variable belief systems is the internal battle in the soul, which pulls people in two directions and affects their thoughts, thinking, and beliefs."
1057,"It is this internal battle between the soul components, those which God created, and the 89 acquired Sinful Nature which humans created, which causes such large variations in belief systems among humans."
1058,"And this is a key point, that the most important issue which affects how core beliefs are formed and maintained is about the level of influence the Sinful Nature exerts on the soul, and the degree to which the Emotion is allied with that Sinful Nature."
1059,"When irrational and illogical beliefs are the overall theme in a person's life, there is a powerful influence from the Sinful Nature strongly allied with the Emotion influencing that person."
1060,"That is because two non-rational actors got together and tried to come up with a rational thought and belief, but failed miserably."
1061,"It cannot be overstated how much the Sinful Nature/Emotion alliance negatively affects the thoughts, thinking, and beliefs of humans."
1062,"Of course, we are not discussing an occasional odd belief, since there are many reasons for those."
1063,"A person gets into such a condition by making wrong decisions, one after another."
1064,"Rejection of God and His Word is a primary cause, but not the only one."
1065,People who reject God must approach life using their Heart and Mind to understand what God has designed into the universe as proper thinking and beliefs based on what seems to work out well.
1066,There is a cause-and-effect system built into God's design.
1067,"This usually starts out rather slowly, but builds into a hardened soul over time if it is not controlled."
1068,"Emotion must only come in after these primary soul players have first built a basis of understanding and wisdom, which leads to loving God."
1069,"At that point the Emotion can fulfill its true role to appreciate, rather than lead the soul and react."
1070,"After all, reality is obvious, is it not?"
1071,"The answer is that people who allow their Sinful Nature to take control of their Emotion on a regular basis will have a soul where the Heart is not in control, and therefore the Mind is suppressed from logical thinking."
1072,That means logic and rational thought is overcome by emotional feelings linked with beliefs based on premises which do not align with the truth and reality God has put in place.
1073,"This is why people can be so diametrically opposed in thinking, why they cannot see what you see so clearly, why people think in ways which do not appear to be real thoughts, and why there is such a political and social divide separating people from each other."
1074,"These are baffling to most people, and for good reason."
1075,Such thoughts and actions do not make sense.
1076,They are illogical and irrational.
1077,"A rational person would want to align themselves with reality and truth, which are ultimately from God."
1078,"But the seeds of revolt against God from the Sinful Nature assures that many people will reject the truth, whether it is the truth about God or the truth about social or political issues."
1079,"It is the Sinful Nature/Emotion alliance which makes feeling one's way through life into a belief system based not on thoughts, but on instincts, hunches, intuition, and other non-thinking approaches."
1080,"This alliance is not logical, it is reactive."
1081,"Of course, this is not an all-or-nothing issue, but rather a matter of degree."
1082,"For some it will be a little, and for others a lot more."
1083,"So this is the reason polarization is so rampant, because so many people have ceased thinking their way through life, and have substituted feeling their way along in a random manner, avoiding reality as they go."
1084,It is the story of human existence.
1085,Many wars have been fought over beliefs.
1086,The belief systems of dictators have squashed individual liberty 91 around the world.
1087,"The Sinful Nature causes serious distortions in thinking since it is not logical, but rather it is instinctive and deviant."
1088,"And recall that God did not give humans instincts to live by, but humans chose to add base instincts when they sinned."
1089,"The more a person gives in to these base instincts, the more illogical and deviant the thinking becomes."
1090,"And even animalistic, as we have seen."
1091,"It seeks to control the entire soul, and tries to distort or block belief in the truth."
1092,"Some people control it better than others, but all are subject to its influence."
1093,"Where there is illogical thought, the Sinful Nature is doing its work unhindered by the truth."
1094,"And when power is added to the equation, the corruption of thought is greatly enhanced."
1095,"Now that we have examined the basics of variability of beliefs, we will continue to explain what the Bible reveals about what happens to the soul when truth is rejected, how humans deal with the unreality they create in their belief systems, why polarization of beliefs is so harmful to societies and nations, and other related subjects."
1096,"We will also explore issues such as dreaming, dementia and Alzheimer's."
1097,"Much more to discuss about thoughts, thinking, and beliefs."
1098,"Next, we explore what most of the people around us actually believe."
1099,"However, there are surprisingly few."
1100,"And most primary belief systems center around self, family, religion, and causes."
1101,"The majority of people who have ever lived have utilized a very basic set of core beliefs, and do not think much about higher level issues."
1102,"In other words, the answer to the question which has been posed regarding what most humans believe is: ""the basics."""
1103,"Therefore most people who ever live will have done so under a system of beliefs focused on living a simple life at a rather low level of thinking and expectations, and therefore apart from God and His plan."
1104,"And it is not simply a matter of education levels, but rather is more about motivation to understand what life is about, and mainly comes down to a religion for most."
1105,"So when we refer to people engaging in higher order thoughts and beliefs it does not refer to the outcomes, but rather to the complexity of the thinking and believing processes involved."
1106,"Therefore the mental processes can be complex correct ones, or they can be complex yet flawed, or even complex and evil."
1107,It just means they are more complex.
1108,We will expand on this shortly.
1109,"The belief systems with the strongest influence over those who hold them center on religion, institutions, family, and self."
1110,"If a person becomes a Christian, that is a higher order belief system."
1111,"There are also higher order belief systems based on supporting causes which a person believes in deeply, whether focused on children or animals or the environment or whatever."
1112,"Those seeking power often have political belief systems, which are also complex."
1113,"Again, that does not imply good or bad, just complex."
1114,Thoughts and beliefs are powerful things because they result in an intensified form of motivation.
1115,"Now that we have that overview in mind, let us now take a look at the various forms of beliefs systems starting with the most basic and working up to the higher level ones."
1116,This belief system is an approach to life which has shown to enable survival and provide at least some level of stability and basic happiness.
1117,"Due to the curse put on the earth after the fall of humans in the Garden of Eden, humans are required to work hard and fight the cursed earth for survival."
1118,"The earth became unfriendly in many ways, and earning a living to care for family took most of one's efforts."
1119,"The remaining time was often spent doing chores and caring for family, plus trying to relax and avoid physical or mental exertion."
1120,The next work day will come around soon.
1121,"It is survival level living, thinking, and believing, which works well enough for most people."
1122,This is the level where most people live.
1123,"However, if someone takes this approach but also becomes a Christian or pursues another religion, the mixture of the simple life with complex beliefs about religion puts them into the higher order level of beliefs."
1124,Religion is a complex belief system.
1125,One might ask why people do not strive to think more complex thoughts and have higher order beliefs.
1126,"Life is a daily grind to feed, clothe, and shelter their family, with little time or funds remaining."
1127,"This daily grind uses most of the time, energy, and resources they have available, with very little left over."
1128,Others are just content to have basic beliefs to avoid complexity in the life.
1129,"Many reject religious beliefs, or are merely a joiner but not a practitioner."
1130,"19 Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God."
1131,"20 They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart."""
1132,"Having a family, work, the essentials of life, and being a good citizen can enable them to lead a rather normal and contented life."
1133,But then eternity is a different matter.
1134,"Some people prefer living at a basic level where they think in basic and repeatable ways, and purposely avoid dealing with complexity."
1135,Complex thoughts and beliefs require more complex coping systems to overcome the issues they bring with them.
1136,"Remember, this simple level of belief system does not apply to believers, since Bible beliefs are the highest level belief system, even if one lives rather simply."
1137,These people avoid deep thoughts in favor of the endless pursuit of pleasure.
1138,"And not all lusts are carnal, but rather many are based on self-righteousness."
1139,This form of avoidance is appealing to many who want to live simply yet not be tied to the order God ordained for humans.
1140,Other types of beliefs focus on elevating self far above all others.
1141,"For others, drugs can induce a belief of invincibility and superhuman powers."
1142,And politicians believe laws do not apply to them.
1143,"Taxing authorities believe your 95 money actually belongs to them, and only let you keep some of it out of generosity."
1144,It is one of the strongest belief systems among people.
1145,And it is based on an unrealistic and therefore false view of one's own importance.
1146,There are also plenty of criminals around who live life using a low level belief system.
1147,"The victims were too weak anyway, so they do not matter, so at least Darwin would approve."
1148,"Recall our discussion of how the original sin created the Sinful Nature, which brought animalistic instincts into the human soul."
1149,"Therefore many people are content to live at a basic level of thought and belief, which avoids complexity in the life."
1150,"That is happiness to them, or at least it works for them in some way."
1151,"But this is no excuse for refusing to think about God and the eternal future, since the most important beliefs in life revolve around these issues."
1152,"Let us pause and explain that these belief systems can be mixed and matched, with a person holding to some or all of several different types."
1153,Belief systems cannot be put into exact molds.
1154,"And there are many sub-categories of belief systems, but we are merely trying to give examples of what belief systems are most prevalent among humans."
1155,"Christians are certainly in this category, but also many others."
1156,"After all, nonsense can be more complex than the truth if someone works hard enough at developing it."
1157,"Higher level belief systems have key beliefs called ""ideology"" which dominate in the soul, and are the most deeply held components of one's beliefs."
1158,"And if a person starts with an ideology which is false, there is little hope for having a belief system which aligns with either reality or truth."
1159,The key is whether that ideology is correct or false.
1160,"We believe the ideology of the Christian Bible is true, so to the believer it is what drives every other subset belief."
1161,"We believe our belief system is both true and aligns with reality, because God created both truth and reality."
1162,"In our view, belief systems which do not align with the Bible are flawed to whatever degree they are in conflict."
1163,"Those who reject Biblical theology, such as all other religions, develop ideologies and use them as their basis for thought and beliefs, to various degrees of accuracy."
1164,Ideologies are powerful and persistent drivers of human action.
1165,"When ideologies are based on reality to a large degree they can be constructive, but when they are aligned with anything else they become destructive."
1166,Even Satan has an ideology focused on opposing God and avoiding his ultimate fate of being cast into the Lake of Fire forever.
1167,That ideology has been the basis for much human suffering.
1168,"Now that we have discussed the variety of belief systems, from simple to complex, we will next look at some of the distractions involved in forming belief systems, and why people succumb to them."
1169,"In ancient times it was easier to avoid complexity in life, since there were far fewer distractions available."
1170,But technology and other issues have changed that.
1171,"The less time spent in thinking, the more thinking becomes feared."
1172,"And so the 97 cycle of Distractionism repeats, over and over."
1173,"In fact, Distractionism is the number one impediment to a useful belief system in the world today."
1174,"Nothing wrong with using technology to enhance the life, or to play mindless games occasionally, but it is a matter of degree."
1175,"If technology is used to consistently avoid thinking and higher order beliefs, especially about God, then it has turned into Distractionism."
1176,"Additionally, social pressures keep some from rising above peers to avoid appearing snobbish, which would lead to rejection by their group."
1177,This often happens among friends and co- workers where there is a strong opposition to class differences.
1178,"But social pressure complicates life, so it is easier to stay within expected boundaries."
1179,"The list of reasons people use to avoid higher order thoughts and beliefs is long, but the point is they exist, and they do affect the belief systems of people."
1180,Therefore some choose to have a low level belief system because it suits them better for some reason or another.
1181,A person can live a simple life but have higher order beliefs.
1182,"This is not a commentary on lifestyles, but rather on beliefs."
1183,"And some people believe what others tell them they should believe, which is a loose form of group-thinking without a defined group."
1184,This is belief by popularity of ideas.
1185,"People look around and determine subjectively what others believe, or say they believe, and then accept them as true."
1186,Often the person joins a group and accepts the beliefs of that group.
1187,"That approach leads to decisions on beliefs based on fear of rejection, and one's own belief system is formed by group consensus."
1188,"This form of belief by popularity is very powerful, with very high pressure for conformance."
1189,"Their mantra is ""Believe as I do or get out of our group."""
1190,Social ostracism forces conformance and congruence of thought and belief.
1191,"This is often 98 called ""group-think"" but takes many forms, often subtle, and usually is enforced by expulsion from the group for lack of conformity."
1192,"We can see that this is a powerful belief system, but the beliefs themselves are often fungible and imprecise."
1193,"This belief system tends to drive the entire thought process, regardless of logic or rationality."
1194,"Whatever lines up with the party line is immediately accepted without scrutiny, debate, inspection, or thought of any kind."
1195,"The ""Party"" cannot be wrong, and it is the center of all beliefs for such a person."
1196,"If it sounds like a religion, that is correct, because it is a secular one."
1197,"Logic, science, and Biblical truth cannot penetrate the darkness of a party line belief system."
1198,"But a belief system does not need to be based on anything real, true, or factual."
1199,And it does.
1200,"The supposition is that these people have it all, so they should be happy."
1201,But they are not.
1202,"If a person with simple beliefs sees how people who ""have it all"" can be such sad examples of humanity, it makes them feel better by comparison."
1203,"So as long as people have someone to look down on, they have some measure of self-esteem."
1204,"This would be a belief system based on looking down on others by comparison, and elevating self without having to do anything."
1205,Just an observation.
1206,"One might think this would be a reasonable approach, and it can be as a part of one's belief system if the science is accurate."
1207,But science must be put into the proper perspective.
1208,"The phrase ""garbage in-garbage out"" was invented by scientists."
1209,"The process is dependent on people who must input facts, conditions and assumptions, who must use conjecture sparingly, and the variables must be highly controlled."
1210,"Therefore when someone says they rely on the science, we need to first know that they used highly accurate data and sufficiently controlled the important variables."
1211,"One variable is time, and the farther out the model projects the possible outcomes, the less accurate it will be."
1212,Therefore science can only explain a tiny bit of everything in the universe.
1213,"True science simply tries to understand what God has designed, without undue speculation."
1214,Belief systems are also formed based on supporting causes or trying to improve the world.
1215,They want to save something or help with something.
1216,"Radical environmentalism is one of the more popular examples, but there are many others."
1217,And they focus on it in a self-destructive way.
1218,"There is a way to support a cause which makes improvements, but there is also a way to use it to try to avoid the reality of missing out on the true meaning and purpose of life."
1219,"Being neutral in all situations is the goal, which is not the definition of the perfect human."
1220,"To them, nothing is worth taking a position to defend as right or wrong."
1221,The opposite is true.
1222,People without firm beliefs are empty shells without conviction or purpose.
1223,"But there is only one form of correct thoughts and beliefs, as outlined in the Bible."
1224,"No one fulfills this perfectly, except for Jesus Christ."
1225,"Christians have the opportunity to have correct thoughts and beliefs to the highest degree, but there are many levels of achievement among them."
1226,First we must choose to accept salvation by faith in Jesus Christ.
1227,"Then after we choose salvation, we are required to grow spiritually by learning the Word of God."
1228,We will expand on this one and only correct belief system later.
1229,"There are additional types of belief systems, but the purpose of this chapter is merely to provide some examples of the most popular ones, not to list or explain all of them."
1230,Or nonsensical.
1231,"And not everything is right or wrong, since some things are merely personal choices."
1232,"But it is the core beliefs which drive most people, if they have any."
1233,"For those who do not, they just muddle through life trying to avoid thinking too much or taking a firm position on anything."
1234,But let us pause for a moment and examine our purpose here.
1235,"Most people are generally just trying to make their way through life, to survive and also have some degree of comfort and happiness."
1236,"Whether they live at a low level of thoughts and beliefs, or something viewed as higher level, is not the point."
1237,"The issue is whether their thoughts and beliefs are in alignment with the truth, or an alternative route based on something else."
1238,"And there can only be one truly correct way, and it is found through the Bible."
1239,"And if a belief system does not lead to eternal life, what good is it?"
1240,"101 For those believers who focus on their spiritual life after salvation, their belief system will be based on the Word of God and doing what God wishes them to do."
1241,"Of course, there are various degrees of success in this path, and differences of opinion."
1242,"But for those believers who neglect or even reject their spiritual growth, they will live generally as the unbelievers live, with mixed-up thoughts and beliefs, even though they are saved."
1243,"For unbelievers, having rejected God and His gracious offer of salvation, they must find alternate paths in a search for happiness."
1244,"Some are content in this and live that life, while others seek ""meaning"" in life, since they do not have God to give them meaning, purpose and fulfillment."
1245,"Nothing wrong with that, except that it can distract from thinking about God and eternity."
1246,"This is where people form alternate belief systems designed to make them believe they are better, more advanced, or superior people."
1247,"They compare themselves to others, and especially those who believe and trust in God."
1248,"This often becomes a secular salvation by comparison approach, not of eternal salvation but a temporal salvation from guilt and despair over having no real purpose in life."
1249,"The only true sense of purpose, and the only belief system which has meaning, is the one which lines up with the plan of God."
1250,"That is, salvation, and living a spiritual life as outlined in the Word of God, thinking and believing as God has instructed us, living by the only source of truth, and having a meaningful life."
1251,"But for now, take a look around at the world, and you will see many bad examples of what people view as higher order belief systems."
1252,"There are those who set themselves up as elite members of the keepers of the truth as they view it, although they oppose Biblical truth."
1253,Politicians are often a good example of bad beliefs.
1254,"Power is their primary belief system, but only for themselves, not for the general population."
1255,"Truth is whatever they say it is, but they lie without apology, while truly believing their own lies."
1256,"Once again we see how higher order beliefs, although complex, can be destructive."
1257,And the world suffers as a result.
1258,We will now take a closer look at why people reject truth.
1259,"Recall that the Heart is not the Emotion as is often erroneously stated, but rather the thinking engine of the soul which interfaces with the outside world and with God."
1260,"God is the source of logic, and He has given it to humans as a gift."
1261,The issue of truth rejection or acceptance plays a major role in human thoughts and beliefs.
1262,"While there can be many reasons for occasionally rejecting truth, there are two overarching factors which cause persistent truth rejection, namely, existing core beliefs which do not align with truth, and distortions in the thinking processes."
1263,"When a person has distorted existing core beliefs, new thoughts and beliefs which oppose them are difficult to accept unless existing beliefs are first rejected or set aside."
1264,"And it is the core beliefs which are most important among all beliefs since they determine what will be accepted as true in the future, since a comparison is made with existing beliefs, and especially core beliefs, when new information is being considered."
1265,"Core beliefs strongly influence how a person views the world, spiritual issues, other people, and so on."
1266,Therefore changing incorrect core beliefs often takes a personal crisis or disaster.
1267,"As previously noted, beliefs are powerful things."
1268,"We will expand further on this issue over the next several chapters, and also look at the mechanisms people use to deflect and avoid truth and reality."
1269,"When people allow their Emotion to join the Sinful Nature in a revolt against the soul's Heart, alternate pathways in the soul are formed which by-pass the logical advisors as the source of logic and truth."
1270,This usually starts slowly and builds over time.
1271,"One result is arrogance, which is the biggest blinder of people."
1272,"And Satan's Cosmic System constantly promotes distortions and lies, feeding this alliance."
1273,"The result is rejection of truth in favor of Cosmic System lies, and the longer this continues, the more locked-in it becomes so that the person eventually lives in a state of unreality."
1274,"There are many lesser reasons such as misunderstandings and indifference, but our discussion relates to persistent and intentional refusal to accept that which is true."
1275,"Of course we recognize there are gray areas, but that is not a matter of truth and reality vs. lies and unreality, which is what we are discussing here."
1276,"We do not live in a perfect world, but there is truth, and there is reality."
1277,Humans have many forms of ideology which oppose truth.
1278,Such people look down on Christians for believing in God and believing in what the Bible reveals.
1279,"To them, they have evolved way beyond the need for God."
1280,They either deny God or say He cannot impose rules on them.
1281,They believe in themselves as a god who can control their own destiny.
1282,"Good or bad, moral or immoral, constructive or destructive, ideology will drive behavior in compelling ways."
1283,"That is because alternate beliefs which deny or avoid truth and reality cannot make sense of one's life, or understand what God has designed."
1284,"Arrogance is the biggest blinder of people, and it is a product of the Sinful Nature-Emotion alliance."
1285,"Look at Satan, who told himself he could ""be like the most high God"" and really believed it, and tried to overthrow God."
1286,And lies from such people are more likely to be accepted as true by the masses of people than the Bible.
1287,"Once again, combining the distortions of the Sinful Nature with the non-thinking Emotion will inevitably lead to the inability to accept the truth of either reality or God's Word due to the blinding effects of arrogance."
1288,"And when truth and reality are rejected, all that remains is varying forms of untruth and lies."
1289,"Unreality and lies will be accepted as true by someone, somewhere, and often by a lot of people everywhere."
1290,"Again, just take a look around at the state of the world."
1291,"When a maximum number of people in a society reject truth, all that is left for them to believe is the lies."
1292,People who see themselves as advanced humans due to progressiveness of their thoughts and beliefs hate the non-progressives.
1293,Then super-progressed people hate those who have only semi-progressed in beliefs.
1294,And on it goes.
1295,"Such people view themselves as thinking higher order thoughts and having higher order beliefs, but they actually engage in a very ancient practice of low level, and often criminal, thoughts and beliefs."
1296,"The lie is how Satan got his start, as he is called ""a liar from the beginning."""
1297,"The absurdity is apparent to all others, 106 but to the progressive initiants all they can see is superiority of self as an advanced life-form."
1298,"In other words, a lie."
1299,"We have seen how the enemy of reality in thought and beliefs is the Emotion aligned with the Sinful Nature, over-ruling the Mind and Heart to suppress thought and beliefs related to reality and truth."
1300,"The result is what we have today, a society of people who hate and lie and deceive and manipulate to get what they want, at the expense of innocent others, all due to the misguided self-delusion that they have progressed beyond formerly acceptable, but now outdated, beliefs."
1301,"Into this discord they exert themselves as power brokers and power seekers, in order to gain control over others they see as inferior."
1302,In this society and under this set of thoughts and beliefs there is no truth and nothing honorable.
1303,"Only hatred, self-promotion, greed, power lust, and lies."
1304,And Bible truth is one of the things such people hate most strongly.
1305,"In contrast the Bible emphasizes love as the basis for thinking, making Christianity the only belief system based on love."
1306,"These can include the fallacy that all opinions have equal value, so that the opinion of every person must be valued."
1307,That assumes there is no truth.
1308,"Of course, people who believe what is false should be encouraged to see why the truth is better."
1309,But opinions either line up with truth or they do not.
1310,"Opinions which are opposed to the truth are lies, and should be treated as such."
1311,"There is also a method of denying truth which says that if someone who is generally on the side of truth fails in some way, then all their beliefs are wrong."
1312,"This is often used on Christians, who are all sinners, but are often labeled hypocrites for being believers yet continue to sin."
1313,"This fallacy states that lies and truth cannot be sorted out since they are all mixed together, and since they cannot be perfectly sorted out, nothing can be viewed as reality or truth."
1314,God rejects relative comparisons as the method of separating truth from lies.
1315,"Truth is truth, and lies are lies."
1316,"Under this fallacy everything is relative, and no belief system is superior to any other."
1317,"But the Bible declares there is truth, and also that there is non-truth and/or lies, and that there is right and wrong."
1318,Note the emphasis on thinking.
1319,"""It"" is not all relative."
1320,"There is truth, and there are lies."
1321,"There are others, but these serve to illustrate various methods of denying, disregarding, and distorting the truth."
1322,"He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him."
1323,"When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."""
1324,"This makes the Emotion the wild card of the soul, sometimes aligning with 108 the logical advisors, and sometimes aligning with the Sinful Nature."
1325,"When the Heart of the soul is taken over by the Sinful Nature backed by the Emotion, the logical advisors of the soul, including the human spirit for the believer, are mostly shut off from influencing the Heart, while the Sinful Nature and Emotion take control of the soul."
1326,"This locks in a cycle of arrogance in the soul, which grows like a cancer if not stopped."
1327,Therefore the Sinful Nature aligned with the Emotion sets up roadblocks to truth.
1328,"The Sinful Nature teamed up with the wild card Emotion becomes the primary alternate pathway for expressions, and one of the main keys to understanding the issue of truth reception vs. rejection."
1329,"Therefore the Sinful Nature and Emotion end up doing the ""pseudo thinking"" for the person."
1330,"The distorter of the soul, the Sinful Nature allied with the Emotion, attempt to block logic in the Mind."
1331,"When a person gets into this hardened status in the soul, the Emotion can block the ability to believe even what the person would like to believe."
1332,"The Mind would normally look at truth and see it as worth believing, but the Emotion comes in and blocks acceptance."
1333,"Maybe just a little at first, or maybe a strong reaction due to some shock like the death of a loved one."
1334,"As the cycle continues, this reaction becomes more firmly set, and eventually no spiritual belief is even possible."
1335,"As they get older they may begin to think about their own death, and would like to explore salvation by faith in Christ."
1336,"This is why early consideration of the gospel message is important, before the soul becomes hardened."
1337,"This often results in a dual personality, sometimes mild or sometimes resulting in neurosis or psychosis."
1338,"Therefore this status is not necessarily all or nothing, so it can either be isolated to certain subject areas or it can be widespread."
1339,"There can be pockets of logic if the person has built up strong standards in certain areas, but the soul is still able to easily reject truth in the affected areas."
1340,"The Heart can only think and make good decisions by integrating the inputs from the various logical advisors such as the Conscience, Memory, and so on, but when it is by-passed by the Sinful Nature allied with the out of control Emotion, the person literally cannot think clearly about certain subjects, but can only emote within the cosmic system jumble of pseudo information and lies."
1341,"The person who emotes their way through life will especially reject the truth when it comes to issues which relate to God and other important information which Satan opposes, and that is another key to why truth is rejected."
1342,"Therefore Satan especially focuses on gaining advantages at certain strategic areas of life where power exists, such as politics and the media, since they are some of the most efficient and effective ways for Satan to broadcast lies into the general population."
1343,"Satan is the ""father of lies"" and Satan's Cosmic System is fueled by lies."
1344,"Remember why this matters to Satan, that he is highly focused on changing the outcome of his sentence to the Lake of Fire."
1345,Therefore Satan directs his lies toward the human race as he attempts to alter his decreed outcome.
1346,"Most people of the world are inside Satan's Cosmic System, and are therefore influenced by that system to promote Satan's lies, even though they would be shocked to understand that issue."
1347,Nothing can be proven to a person under such circumstances.
1348,"The Sinful Nature takes over to determine what is ""right"" so that wrong easily becomes right to that person as the Conscience becomes distorted."
1349,"If the soul is out of control, dominated by the Sinful Nature in alliance with the Emotion, they look arrogantly at the truth and call it a lie, and look at a lie and call it the truth."
1350,"The longer they do so, the easier it becomes."
1351,It is the answer to why people reject the truth in favor of the lie.
1352,It is the answer to why the Cosmic System is so popular among people.
1353,"This brings us to a central point about how salvation is accepted, and also how truth is acquired from the Bible."
1354,Faith is belief.
1355,Recall that is what this book is about.
1356,"Faith accepts from God what we do not deserve, including salvation and our spiritual life."
1357,"Faith believes that God, as the source of the Bible and salvation, is worth believing, that He is trustworthy, and that He tells the truth."
1358,"Faith is the only method authorized by God for acquiring spiritual information, and avoids merit and works by the recipient."
1359,"God specifically excluded salvation by the senses, by deep thinking using rationalism, or any form of proof since these are based on merit and individual effort."
1360,"Using such merit-based processes as a means for salvation would be patently unfair, since some would have inherent advantages over others."
1361,Therefore only the smartest and deepest thinkers would be saved.
1362,God rejects such unfairness.
1363,"Instead, salvation is by faith only, and the message of salvation can be easily understood by anyone who is willing to listen and consider it."
1364,"God does not allow His plan for salvation to be proven, and therefore requires that it must be accepted only by faith."
1365,"The faith of the person, 113 which is belief, is apart from any work or merit."
1366,"Therefore humans can take no credit for any part of salvation, leaving all the credit to Jesus Christ the Savior."
1367,He did the work.
1368,He gets the credit and glory.
1369,And therefore salvation is a free gift from God.
1370,"Humans must first think that salvation is by faith in Jesus Christ the only Savior, and then must believe it to be saved."
1371,"Beliefs come from thoughts, so thoughts and thinking precede beliefs."
1372,"We think it, then we believe it or reject it."
1373,"Our life is about choices, for or against God, for or against truth."
1374,"Without that belief, everything else is simply muddling through life in a manner which ultimately has no meaning beyond death."
1375,"OK, that was intense."
1376,It is time to have some fun.
1377,Let's discuss dreaming.
1378,"Why is it so odd, and disconnected from the reality of our waking life?"
1379,"Glad you asked, because it is a very interesting and even fun subject."
1380,"And although dreaming is somewhat related to our thoughts and beliefs, there are some odd twists and turns."
1381,"Science cannot figure out the sleep and dreaming issue, although they have tried very hard to do so."
1382,"That is because science does not believe in a human soul, and dreaming occurs in the soul."
1383,"Therefore dreaming helps to further reveal the presence of a soul in humans, for those willing to see it."
1384,Some truly bizarre.
1385,"Memories may not be accurately recalled, even though we know the reality very well when awake."
1386,"Time may be distorted, with the dreamer at a previous point in their life, or in the future."
1387,We go from one place to another without transportation.
1388,Things and people randomly appear and disappear.
1389,"We do odd, hazardous, and bizarre things which we would never do in real life."
1390,"We try to perform tasks which are easy for us, but we cannot."
1391,Absurdities abound.
1392,We get caught in do-loops.
1393,The laws of physics are suspended.
1394,We hardly recognize the person who is posing as us in our own dreams.
1395,"Humans are not animals as we have discussed, but let us start with how animals dream, which is very different than humans."
1396,"Animals can have ""brain dreams"" because they have no soul, but only about instinctive activities such as running, climbing and other muscle memory activities."
1397,"But since humans have almost no instincts except for a few in newborns, we cannot 115 dream from the brain."
1398,"For humans, dreaming is a soul activity, even though it seems like the soul has missing pieces."
1399,"In fact, it does have missing pieces during sleep and dreaming."
1400,"Actually, parts of the soul go offline during sleep, but not the entire soul all at once."
1401,"The first conclusion we reach is, once again, dreaming is a soul activity, not a brain activity."
1402,It is artistic.
1403,"It is escapism, an escape from toil and repetitive boredom."
1404,"If that means dreaming is about doing something different, then that is an understatement."
1405,"Therefore dreaming results when individual soul components begin exerting some flexibility to operate without full supervision from ""The Boss."""
1406,"That ""Boss"" is the Heart of the soul, the primary component of the soul which shuts down during the majority of sleep."
1407,The Heart is the part of the soul which is in charge.
1408,It makes the decisions and sends out the orders.
1409,It is the controller of the soul.
1410,"But when it shuts down to rest and do maintenance actions, the various other parts of the soul have some vacation time."
1411,There is no one to tell them what to do.
1412,And sometimes more than one soul component goes offline at the same time.
1413,This is why REM sleep dreams can be so different than dreams just before we wake in the morning.
1414,Different parts of the soul are offline at different points of the sleep cycle.
1415,Now for some examples to explain the previous assertions.
1416,"At one point it will be the Memory, or at least portions of it."
1417,"Sometimes the short term Memory is down, then other times longer term Memory, and other times archival Memory is down."
1418,This is why our memories during dreaming can be so far off from reality.
1419,"Soul components go into a ""power saving"" mode during sleep, including Memory which does not function as well during sleep."
1420,"In our dreams we may remember that we are in a certain job, but that might have been years ago."
1421,"But that does not stop us from dreaming about being in that job at the present time, but it may be mixed with later memories, such as being married."
1422,Then people who are now dead appear.
1423,"Therefore during sleep we can be at many different times and locations which occurred during our life, or at no time or location we have ever experienced."
1424,"If the Mind does not supply accurate time and location data, the Memory will invent it."
1425,This makes for some very odd dreams about time and location.
1426,"But it is not the same as being truly unconscious, where waking is difficult or even impossible."
1427,"Being unconscious is not sleep, and dreaming while unconscious probably does not occur, or maybe rarely based on the level of unconsciousness, which are not all the same."
1428,"Those things which affect the brain affect soul awareness, including sleep."
1429,"As mentioned earlier, we know that animals can dream."
1430,"Well, sort of."
1431,But not as humans do.
1432,"Animals dream in repetitive motion and instinctive ways from their sensory center, which is in the brain, and mainly as muscle memory."
1433,"They run away from danger, or chase other animals."
1434,They dream instinctive actions.
1435,But human dreams are not based on instincts or repetitive motion.
1436,"If we bolt upright, we are awake when it occurs."
1437,"Because my soul does not know how to swing a golf club, so it cleverly avoids the subject."
1438,"The soul cannot swing a golf club, but the brain can."
1439,It is the same with any complex repetitive motion sport.
1440,"The dream may include having done the action, but it does not include doing the action, not in any detail, at least."
1441,It would not be the complex scenarios humans dream about which cannot happen in real life.
1442,And so that explains the public nudity thingy.
1443,But only men admit to it.
1444,Women seem to have issues about the subject.
1445,Trick question.
1446,"That definition is OK to define the concept that such things occur, but there is no separate subconscious mind."
1447,"But since the Mind is not always active during sleep, the other components must either wait or invent an outrageous set of bizarre circumstances to fill in the blanks."
1448,"This background processing in the Mind is what some would call a subconscious, but it is actually just background processing inside the Mind."
1449,"Although different than dreaming, a human soul can become disoriented to reality during waking time in much the same way as in dreaming."
1450,"The Heart can be subverted, corrupted, or may abdicate its responsibilities while awake."
1451,Other soul components may abdicate their responsibilities.
1452,The soul can become dysfunctional.
1453,We will discuss these issues next.
1454,"It is a terrible thing for the person involved, and also for those who care about that person."
1455,"This chapter will cover some of the issues related to mental illness and associated maladies, and why they occur."
1456,"However, this chapter will only try to deal with what the Bible says about the subject, and will not attempt to cover the issues in any detail, which would require another book."
1457,"Having said that, the books which have been written on the subject mainly approach the issues from the viewpoint of a dysfunctional brain, not as soul issues."
1458,"A well-known Pastor from the 1800's, C.H."
1459,"Spurgeon, said of this issue: ""The mind can descend far lower than the body, for in it there are bottomless pits."
1460,"The flesh can bear only a certain number of wounds and no more, but the soul can bleed in ten thousand ways, and die over and over again."""
1461,"The soul can become distorted and think and believe things which do not align with reality, as noted in previous chapters."
1462,Our purpose here is to discuss such issues in view of what the Bible reveals about distortions of the human soul.
1463,"While this may often be necessary and useful, it deals with shutting off the soul from the brain using chemical inhibitors."
1464,"While there are exceptions, it is usually the soul which becomes distorted, not the chemicals in the brain."
1465,So it is the soul which leads to most mental maladies.
1466,"There are various forms of mental distortions, maladies, and illnesses which can cause the person to be unable to control their own thought processes."
1467,"And that is the key, loss of control over the soul due to internal battles for control."
1468,"Some of these are present at a low level in most people, although generally occasional and controllable."
1469,"We will now cover this subject in greater detail, and later will discuss the solutions found in the Bible."
1470,And the Bible is the only source of true soul and spirit healing through rehabilitation of thought processes.
1471,"The soul seeks patterns of behavior, usually for repetitive actions and thinking processes to make life easier."
1472,"Instead of internal control by the Heart, an outside force seems to have taken control of the soul."
1473,"And to some degree, that is true."
1474,"That outside force is actually an inside force which is attached to the soul, and is what we have discussed previously as the Sinful Nature."
1475,"It was not given to us by God, but was acquired by the original sin in the Garden of Eden."
1476,"Therefore the Sinful Nature is the legacy of that original sin by our ancestors, passed down to all of us."
1477,"This is counter to psychology and psychiatry which seeks to resolve what they see as physical issues and chemical imbalances, since they do not generally believe there is a soul."
1478,"So even if the Mind becomes convinced, it will often be overruled."
1479,"Instead, the Sinful Nature has taken control of the soul and is aligned with the non-thinking part of the soul, the Emotion, to drive a feeling-based approach to life rather than a thinking and believing approach."
1480,"And God requires a thinking and believing approach to our spiritual life, not an emotional one."
1481,"For instance, schizophrenia and bipolar are a result of an internal battle for control of the soul, on one side by the Heart supported by a rational Mind, and on the other side by the Emotion aligned with the Sinful Nature."
1482,The person can alternate between what they logically understand and what they feel.
1483,"Reasoning with such a person can have a positive effect, but only until they allow the feeling side to take over again."
1484,"The feeling side has a strong arrogance factor due to the influences of the Sinful Nature, which is the source of this sin."
1485,"When the Sinful Nature and Emotion rule the soul, it will decline into a distorted state."
1486,"The by- product is arrogance in the soul, starting out slowly, but building over time."
1487,"This is what creates a manic-depressive state, 122 when the Emotion alternately controls the soul in a high state and then cannot maintain such control of the soul, resulting in a low state as the Emotion pulls back removing emotional involvement, while the Heart remains neutralized by the Sinful Nature."
1488,"Panic attacks can occur in between during the vacuum periods since there is no one in charge of the soul, so it literally cannot think or emote."
1489,Thinking and believing rationally becomes more and more difficult.
1490,"Such distortion begins with mild unreality and soul absurdities, but in later stages becomes illogical chaos."
1491,"The person may remain generally functional, or become mentally incapacitated, or something in between, but they are in a state of unreality to either a small or great extent."
1492,"Therefore the answer to why people can think in such a distorted manner is that when the Emotion is aligned with the Sinful Nature, and these two have created a pattern of over-ruling the Mind and Heart, it eventually becomes a set pattern of arrogance which the person may be unable to break, even if they desire to do so."
1493,"At the same time the Sinful Nature exerts greater control over the soul, creating chaos and non-linear thought processes guided by arrogance, meaning the inability to think clearly."
1494,"The Sinful Nature stages a coup against the Heart, becoming an evil dictator which rules as an illogical and arrogant tyrant, robbing the soul of any hope of peace or happiness."
1495,"Young people can get into this distorted soul cycle during their teen years, and it is important that it be stopped as soon as possible."
1496,"If it is not stopped at an early point, it will become much harder to do so later."
1497,"The resulting mental instability leads to locked-in arrogance which rejects many types of authority, and promotes other mental sins such as hatred, jealousy and envy which cause a severe narrowing of mental tolerance and a near total inability to accept any form of truth in the areas of Sinful Nature-Emotion dominance."
1498,"When this truth denial becomes non- selective it turns into a neurosis or psychosis, but most people do not reach that level of generalized truth rejection."
1499,"These mental sins can overwhelm the soul and cause a shutdown of the Heart, at least in certain areas of life."
1500,The person then lives on the lusts of the Sinful Nature.
1501,"These lusts are not always the carnal type, but rather power, monetary, superiority, and many other lusts which become possible."
1502,"Generally, the mixture of lusts and sins distort the world view."
1503,"Cosmic System devices such as self-delusion, self-absorption, transference, and denial reject the logical deliberations of the soul, and result in a soul which is out of control and unable to process information in a logical manner, except of course in narrow areas of mechanical skills and rote memory application to a job or hobby."
1504,"The mental sin combo of arrogance, envy, jealousy, and hatred rejects truth and authority other than one's own."
1505,"Such people live on lies as their basis for a world view, and truth is a casualty."
1506,"They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil."
1507,"Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched."""
1508,"In this relationship the Emotion is the wild card, and can be a disrupter."
1509,"When the Sinful Nature interferes in soul processes, it first attacks the Emotion by enticing it into an illicit soul relationship, resulting in an upset of the delicate balance in the soul by causing the Emotion to become unhappy with what is going on."
1510,The issues do not need to be rational or reasonable.
1511,"It starts to think ""Hey, what am I -- a potted plant?"""
1512,"and at that point the Emotion, at the encouragement of the Sinful Nature, revolts against the authority of the Heart."
1513,"The Heart fights back and exerts its authority, and there is discordance in the soul."
1514,"That gratification can take the form of self-righteousness or hedonism or anything in between, or maybe both at the same time."
1515,An alternate reality is then created.
1516,"If this is not stopped, it is all downhill from there."
1517,It is at this point where the person begins to lose touch with reality.
1518,A deep sense of unhappiness ensues.
1519,The soul becomes hopelessly confused and depressed.
1520,The soul becomes less and less able to make sense of the reality around it.
1521,Concentration becomes more difficult.
1522,"The person feels a loss of control, but does not understand it."
1523,"At the same time, the standards of the Conscience eventually erode."
1524,"The soul sinks deeper and deeper into unhappiness and unreality, as the mental defense mechanisms fail."
1525,It is at this point that depression becomes the norm.
1526,"The soul can no longer function ""normally."""
1527,Chaos in the soul continues the slide into oblivion.
1528,"The best that can happen at this point is a lack of unhappiness, not happiness."
1529,For convenience we will generally just refer to them as mental distortions.
1530,"125 Everyone has these issues to some degree, so this is not unusual."
1531,"We can only see what is in the world, not what the Bible reveals."
1532,There is a war inside us over control of our thoughts.
1533,"Of course, it does not work that way."
1534,When the soul gets out of control as described above the result is chaos in the soul.
1535,That is soul damage.
1536,"And the damage is real, because the soul is real."
1537,It requires effort and a right approach.
1538,"Only information from the Bible can begin to repair the soul, if it can be accepted and internalized into the human spirit."
1539,Otherwise the mental drift will continue and will intensify.
1540,"The Word of God is alive and powerful, and can eventually overcome the Sinful Nature distortions of the soul and break its influence."
1541,"But it is hard, and takes time and persistence."
1542,Day by day.
1543,"And if medication helps calm the soul to allow study of the Word, then that is a good and proper use for them."
1544,"But the real solution is soul rehabilitation by getting the Heart and Mind back in control, putting the Emotion back into its rightful place, and suppression of the Sinful Nature."
1545,"By now you know the answer, which is that the Sinful Nature is the culprit."
1546,For those answers we must dig even deeper.
1547,"We have seen how the primary target of the Sinful Nature is the Emotion, which is a non- thinking part of the soul."
1548,"The Sinful Nature is an adversary to the Heart and Mind, constantly attempting to stage a coup against them."
1549,"It seeks control, and is not satisfied to stay in the background simply tempting to sin."
1550,"That is far too mundane a task, as far as it is concerned."
1551,"And this is where the true mischief lies, the desire of the Sinful Nature to usurp the Heart and Mind and take control of the soul."
1552,"But on the other hand, the soul's Emotion can take the side of the Sinful Nature and make bad decisions more difficult to avoid."
1553,But the Sinful Nature does not have the ability nor inclination to properly rule the soul.
1554,"It takes the Emotion hostage, a Stockholm Syndrome sets in, then they become allies."
1555,"Like any dictator, the Sinful Nature simply wants power."
1556,But in its ineptness it fails miserably.
1557,"Oddly it does not care, as long as it rules the soul, even if it harms its host, or destroys it."
1558,That is just how things go.
1559,"As Milton suggested in his book ""Paradise Lost"" some would rather rule in Hell than be a servant in Heaven, although that itself is an absurdity."
1560,But the Sinful Nature does not care about absurdity.
1561,"The Sinful Nature is a tyrant, a demagogue, a dictator, a ruthless taskmaster, and any other tyrannical word which can be mustered."
1562,Control is its goal.
1563,And it will stop at nothing to get it.
1564,A person may give in to it little by little.
1565,"Not all that much at first, but it is very patient."
1566,"Repeat the process and it gains more control, and more and more."
1567,"And the Sinful Nature learns as it matures, picking up lust patterns and areas of weakness to certain sins, some more than others."
1568,"""A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come on you like a thief, and scarcity like an armed man."""
1569,And that can be true for believers as well as unbelievers.
1570,"Therefore the inputs which get through to the Heart are from the non-thinking sources, and the person's soul gets more and more out of control, and increasingly dysfunctional."
1571,"Depression, neurosis, psychosis and any of the forms of mental instability and self-destructive behavior become possible at that point."
1572,"Some people look at life from the viewpoint of the soul under the control of the Heart accepting the advice of the logical advisors inside the soul and the human spirit for the believer, and other people look at life from the viewpoint of the Heart under the control of the Sinful Nature backed by Emotion which are out of control, relegating the logical advisors of the soul to a position of low regard."
1573,"However, no believer can be demon possessed, only influenced by Satan's Cosmic System through the Sinful Nature."
1574,"All of this is because the Sinful Nature is part of Satan's realm, since he was the original source of it."
1575,"But we do not need to allow the Sinful Nature to gain control of our soul, and we also do not need the Sinful Nature to maintain control of our soul if it has already taken over."
1576,We will discuss solutions next.
1577,There is a knight in shining armor which can come to the rescue.
1578,However a solution is possible.
1579,"Discouragement would be the natural course at this point, but God always provides an opening for those who are hopeless."
1580,"There is a recovery process outlined in the Bible, and recovery is possible."
1581,"If the Sinful Nature is not resisted and controlled, it will become the dominant force in the life of a person, both unbelievers and believers."
1582,"The issue is not just sin, because no one is immune from it, and God forgives our transgressions."
1583,But rather it is about a coup in the soul whereby the Sinful Nature takes over the soul and replaces the Heart as the leader of the soul.
1584,"And the process for this takeover entails changing thoughts and beliefs to align with Cosmic System thinking, which the Sinful Nature uses to gain advantages and leverage in the soul."
1585,"So the key point here is that the Sinful Nature does not merely try to tempt us to sin, but more importantly it tempts us to reject the plan of God entirely, as well as reality and truth in general."
1586,"Whatever reality and truth support, the Sinful Nature seeks the opposite."
1587,"The longer this continues, the more hardened the soul becomes, and the more difficult recovery becomes."
1588,"When people have gone down the wrong road for a long time, a hard dose of reality is often required to get their attention."
1589,"It is one of the most effective ways to break the hold of the Sinful Nature, at least for a short while, and give the person an opportunity to change the course of their life."
1590,"Arrogance must be broken down, and emotionalism must be suppressed, so reality and truth can get through in the form of real thinking in the Heart."
1591,"If these opportunities are wasted, the likelihood of recovery grows dimmer."
1592,There is no other useful starting point for real solutions.
1593,"Those believers who have gone down the path of giving control of the soul over to the Sinful Nature must take the road to recovery by using the power from the Word of God, not by internal power."
1594,"Therefore the believer is required by God to resist the Sinful Nature and feed the human spirit with the Word of God which is ""alive and powerful"" in order to understand and implement the spiritual life after salvation."
1595,"This is a long and arduous process, and setbacks will abound."
1596,But it is the only long term solution.
1597,"It is a long process, not a quick fix."
1598,"Ephesians 10:6-18 says: ""Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power."
1599,"11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes."
1600,"16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
1601,"17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."""
1602,"They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.” The Bible is full of short and succinct verses which the believer can cling to during times of trouble, hardship, grief and distress."
1603,"The Sinful Nature resides in every human, as we have noted."
1604,"But beyond just sin, the Sinful Nature is also a distorting influence which negatively affects the ability to think clearly and logically."
1605,It is ultimately the source of all mental distortions.
1606,Therefore the key to avoiding mental distortions is control of the Sinful Nature.
1607,"It is a twisted and demented tyrant, and it must be resisted."
1608,"And that resistance comes from the human spirit filled with the Word of God, the source of spiritual strength for the believer."
1609,We cannot will our way to spiritual advance.
1610,Therefore the best way to resist mental distortions is to study and assimilate the Word of God from the time of salvation onward.
1611,"For those who start late in life trying to gain spiritual power, they are at the disadvantage of having to overcome a Sinful Nature which is already in control of the soul."
1612,But it is the only way.
1613,And it is possible because God provides a way of escape.
1614,This is why the Bible says discipline is required to teach children proper behavior early on.
1615,"The antidote to the Sinful Nature is a soul filled with Biblical wisdom, which in turn provides appreciation for God, and eventually love for Him."
1616,"Arrogance is the enemy of the soul, as it opens the way for the Sinful Nature to use the Emotion to attack the Heart and Mind."
1617,"Of course, all humans fail and there are none who do things perfectly."
1618,God knows that we are weak.
1619,He knows we will fail.
1620,God forgives us.
1621,"That is correct, because the Sinful Nature does not care about such things."
1622,"To it, destruction is equally effective as convincing."
1623,The Sinful Nature is not a logical advisor to the soul.
1624,It is an illogical tyrant.
1625,"It must be resisted and pushed back into a tiny hole with a lock on it, with a sign which says ""Do Not Feed The Sinful Nature."""
1626,"Remember, it is the enemy within."
1627,"Therefore these divine laws are meant for the entire human race, unbelievers as well as believers."
1628,But it is more difficult for unbelievers to deal with mental dysfunctions since they have no human spirit.
1629,"Salvation activates the human spirit for the unbeliever, then spiritual growth develops the human spirit, which provides the ultimate in human ""mental development,"" which is in reality soul (and human spirit) spiritual development."
1630,"Therefore unbelievers must first change their mind about God and accept Jesus Christ as Savior, at which point they will gain a human spirit."
1631,From there they can rebuild soul stability.
1632,"So it was left to God to provide a way of escape for sinful humans, and that escape starts with salvation by faith in Jesus Christ."
1633,"That is eternal salvation, but it is not total deliverance from the ongoing effects of our own Sinful Nature which continues to reside in us while we are alive."
1634,Our Sinful Nature is the source of all disruption and distortion in the soul.
1635,"We cannot expunge it, but we can fight it."
1636,And fight we must.
1637,"And that is the second part, which as we 133 have discussed, is fighting the Sinful Nature by God's Word inside of our human spirit."
1638,"Then the human spirit influences the Mind and Heart to restore logical order in the soul, giving the soul stability."
1639,At the birth of any baby it is a blank slate in the soul.
1640,"The five senses get to work quickly and start to develop pattern recognition, and the soul begins to put in place the basis of thinking."
1641,"An empty soul cannot think, therefore the baby starts as a pure empiricist, meaning their learning is sensory based."
1642,Then beliefs will be formed.
1643,"In a similar way, the second birth is regeneration of the human spirit, which is much like being a baby all over again."
1644,A spiritual baby.
1645,"Jesus said we must be ""born again"" to have eternal life."
1646,"The newly ""reborn"" believer has a new empty vessel to begin to fill up, so it can form new spiritual thoughts and beliefs."
1647,"That is exactly what must happen for the believer after salvation, namely to fill up the human spirit with spiritual information."
1648,Otherwise the human spirit is as non-functional as the soul of a newborn baby.
1649,"That is the equivalent of living the spiritual life in the goo-goo-da-da stage, which does not glorify God or the Lord Jesus Christ."
1650,And it also does not resist mental dysfunctions.
1651,After salvation God generally leaves believers on earth to develop the human spirit which is empty at the second birth.
1652,"The power to live a spiritual life is not out of the soul, but rather out of the human spirit."
1653,"The soul can never accomplish what the Bible requires of believers because it is not a spiritual entity, even though it is an immaterial entity."
1654,"We are here for a spiritual purpose, not a soulish purpose."
1655,"134 However, most believers fail to fulfill their spiritual requirements."
1656,They leave their human spirit in a status of being a newborn.
1657,"2 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it."
1658,"Indeed, you are still not ready."
1659,"3 You are still worldly."""
1660,"Without that constant intake of spiritual food, the human spirit is empty or close to it, so the Holy Spirit has little to use to empower the spiritual life of the believer."
1661,Those who exercise their human spirit and feed it spiritual truth will grow in spiritual strength and provide the Holy Spirit with what He requires to empower the believer to have impact for the Lord.
1662,"With the consistent intake of spiritual food, the human spirit stores up information the Holy Spirit can use to empower an effective spiritual life of the believer."
1663,"We are in the midst of spiritual warfare with the forces of darkness, and we must be armed to fight the spiritual battles."
1664,"The desire to please God by knowing and applying His Word through the human spirit, the only spiritual part of the human, is what our spiritual life is all about."
1665,"135 The human spirit filled with the Word of God is able to generally control the lusts of the Sinful Nature, and directs the soul to fulfill the will of God for us."
1666,"That is the spiritual life -- living out of the human spirit, which directs the soul to properly interface with the outside world and with God on the basis of the Word of God."
1667,"At this point ""the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."""
1668,And a quiet soul in not possible when the Sinful Nature is in control of the soul.
1669,Now we are discussing changing beliefs.
1670,"The actions of the believer follow the directions of the human spirit through the soul, and all based on God's Word."
1671,"We are strengthened by the Word of God in our human spirit, which in turn changes our beliefs and drives our decisions and actions as the human spirit directs the soul."
1672,"Power for our lives is through the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit is instrumental in helping us learn the Word of God if we study it."
1673,"The power is in the Word, the Word which has been put into our human spirit by the mentoring of the Holy Spirit, and only then do we live a spiritual life with impact."
1674,"As that spiritual structure in the human spirit is built up, the faith and spiritual dynamics of the believer increases."
1675,136 The only spiritual part of a human is the human spirit.
1676,"When did anyone shut down their soul and refuse to take in any more sensory information, or learning?"
1677,"The human spirit must continuously ""grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."""
1678,Mental maladies are the result.
1679,"The growth of the human spirit must be the lifelong mission of the believer, because we are required to grow up spiritually after our rebirth."
1680,"1 Peter 2:2 says ""Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation."""
1681,Therefore the only way to counter and overcome the Sinful Nature-Emotion lock on the soul is through a very intensive study and application of the Word of God.
1682,"But this is very difficult due to the deeply rooted reactions which will come from the Emotion, and the resistance from the Sinful Nature which has taken over control of the soul."
1683,"Once it has gained control, it is difficult to depose."
1684,But this is the only rehabilitation process.
1685,It is hard and takes a very long time.
1686,"Results will be spotty at first, and setbacks will abound."
1687,But it is the only road back.
1688,And with God and His Word it is possible.
1689,"But what happens to the real person, the inner human, during this process?"
1690,"These issues result from diseases, syndromes, and also trauma, so all are not equal."
1691,These dysfunctions affect the brain side of the equation but not the soul side.
1692,"The answer is that the soul is not designed to function isolated from a body, either during the natural lifetime or during eternity."
1693,"The soul can only operate correctly from inside a support structure which is working as required, meaning a physical body while living on earth, or in an eternal body later."
1694,"Which means that without support from the brain, or a new body during eternity, the soul cannot express itself."
1695,"And when the brain is 138 diminished, the overall process of brain to soul and back to brain information flow is diminished."
1696,Therefore the person who has diminished mental functions has reduced ability to develop new thoughts internal to the soul.
1697,"The level to which this occurs depends on the degree of impairment, so it is not all or nothing."
1698,"The point here is that although the brain is diminished, the soul status will remain generally static until death, when the soul departs and is placed into a new body, first into a temporary one until their resurrection occurs, and later into a final body at the resurrection."
1699,"For Church Age believers, the final resurrection is called the Rapture of the Church."
1700,"Therefore, after death the believer's soul and human spirit are taken to Heaven where they are placed into a temporary body, and soul functions and memories become available again at that moment."
1701,"However, the memories stop at the point new information could no longer effectively be taken into the soul while still alive."
1702,"For unbelievers, there is also a new body after death, and it is designed for their eternal state, which is much different."
1703,"They will also have memories, but will only serve to feed their regrets of failure to do the one thing required of them to be saved."
1704,"It should therefore be comforting to know that this condition is only temporary, that the soul of the person remains unchanged, and after death will be the same person with soul memories intact."
1705,Then all involved can pick up where they left off.
1706,"In a similar way, those who are born with issues which restrict mental development may not be able to fully develop the soul due to limitations in brain capabilities."
1707,"In other instances the soul can become more fully developed, but the brain cannot export the results to the outside world due to limitations on the outbound part of the brain."
1708,"The person is forced to live a more sensory life, and more out of the brain with less soul involvement, which means less soul control over their actions."
1709,"There are many variations, so this is just to explain that brain to soul, and soul back to brain interface issues can cause soul isolation or inability to perform in some areas."
1710,Then we will also look at outside evil influences on thoughts and beliefs.
1711,"The word ""evil"" is commonly used to describe a depraved person who engages in vile actions, such as a cruel and oppressive dictator, a mass murderer, a satanic cult leader, or some similarly very disagreeable person who engages in wanton and heinous misdeeds."
1712,"While all of this may be true, that view of evil is too narrow to align with God's view."
1713,"The Bible defines evil as being much more complex, inclusive and pervasive than common usage would suggest."
1714,Evil at its core is about opposition to God and His plan.
1715,"It helps to understand the subject of evil by describing those creatures, both angelic and human, the Bible calls evil."
1716,"Evil is mentioned very early in the Bible in Genesis when Adam and the woman were in the Garden of Eden, but evil began way before that, long before there were humans."
1717,"As one might suspect, it began with Satan, an outside influencer on thoughts and beliefs."
1718,"Therefore, when a created creature acts in opposition to God, that act is evil, and when one thinks and acts consistently in opposition to God, that 141 person or creature is actually evil."
1719,"The fall of Satan at his original sin was an act of evil, and in fact it was the very first evil which ever occurred."
1720,"Rejection of salvation is a form of evil since it is calling God a liar, which is opposition to God."
1721,"And by rejecting salvation unbelievers are saying that the Bible is a lie, and that Jesus Christ is not the Savior."
1722,We can see that evil is indeed far more inclusive and pervasive than most would think.
1723,Adam and Eve chose evil when they sinned in the Garden of Eden.
1724,"She was deceived and wrong, but then Adam joined her, fully understanding what he was doing."
1725,"Creatures invented evil by rejecting God, first Satan, and then Adam and Eve created it for humans."
1726,We see that the original sin by Satan was the first act of evil since it was a revolt against God.
1727,"So also the first sin by humans led the previously righteous man and woman to commit an act of evil, which was also rebellion against God."
1728,"The man and woman had not known sin or evil before they revolted against God, but they learned about both at the same time."
1729,"When the Bible says they now knew evil it means they had gained a Sinful Nature as an attachment to the soul, which started the process of feeding evil thoughts into their souls."
1730,"And they chose for all humans, who would inherit the Sinful Nature and all its negative effects on thoughts and beliefs."
1731,"This gaining of a Sinful Nature by the original humans was a loss of status which also took them into a condition of being evil, having taken the side of Satan even though it was by deceit."
1732,At this point their thoughts and beliefs included evil.
1733,"The word ""sin"" here refers more generally to Sinful Nature influences on the soul, not a single sin by itself."
1734,"The first humans had fallen from perfection into a status of being unacceptable to God, therefore unsaved."
1735,"But God provided a way of salvation, and the two believed in the promised Messiah and were saved."
1736,But they did not lose their knowledge of evil since it was now part of their souls due to the Sinful Nature they acquired at the point of their fall.
1737,"For the descendants of Adam and Eve, the Sinful Nature became attached to the soul at birth."
1738,"After salvation the believer still has a Sinful Nature but can partially overcome it, with various degrees of success."
1739,"Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."""
1740,"The lust for money can lead to doing evil to gain it, often in a way which does significant harm to others."
1741,"Evil actions are usually a pattern involving lust and scheming, not normally an isolated sin."
1742,"People who live by their lusts are called evil, since evil thinking becomes a pattern of evil action which harms others."
1743,"We see that evil always begins with evil thoughts, which lead to evil beliefs, which can lead to evil actions."
1744,"There are also evil institutions, not just creatures."
1745,Nations can be evil.
1746,"Some of them oppose God by suppressing the gospel of salvation and Bible teaching, and others use their power to consistently harm the innocent as a pattern of action."
1747,"There are many evil nations, and for different reasons."
1748,"Others sponsor or support terrorism, which is intended to deny freedom and impose an alternate system of acting and thinking."
1749,"Some impose evil institutions by force, such as false religions, or socialism which takes by force what belongs to some and gives it to others."
1750,"Laws can be evil, especially those which attempt to suppress freedom to worship and evangelize."
1751,"This should not be surprising since Satan rules this world, and he and his Cosmic System are both pure evil."
1752,"Satan is the author of chaos, and the history of mankind is one of mostly evil nations with very occasional exceptions."
1753,"Evil is not always glaring, but is often subtle."
1754,"God promotes free will and the right to choose, but evil opposes both."
1755,"While there is more to discuss on this sad fact, what has been described so far should begin to bring some clarity to the issue."
1756,This book is about thoughts and beliefs.
1757,"The downfall of human thoughts and beliefs started with Satan, whose own thoughts and beliefs strayed from serving God to serving self."
1758,"Then as a result of his thoughts and beliefs, Satan acted on them and revolted against God."
1759,And they did.
1760,Thoughts and beliefs are powerful things.
1761,They can drive good or evil.
1762,Some of them are used simply to get by.
1763,"Others are used as defense mechanisms to build up one's own self-esteem, often at the expense of others."
1764,Some coping mechanisms are used to avoid thinking about much of anything.
1765,"Regardless of the reason, these false coping devices are aimed at avoiding reality and truth."
1766,"To this end, humans have invented false devices and strategies to avoid reality and also elevate themselves in their own view."
1767,But they are all attempts to overcome internal friction and pressure in the soul.
1768,"Distraction is one such mental coping device, which attempts to avoid issues by trying not to think about them."
1769,"Of course, enjoying some amount of distraction is useful and relaxing, but we are discussing endless distraction, which becomes Distractionism."
1770,"In all of this, Distractionism is about avoiding reality, and wasting the time we have remaining."
1771,That is the ultimate reality which must not be avoided.
1772,"And by the way, there will be no distractions for unbelievers during eternity."
1773,Reality will be unavoidable.
1774,"Ultimately, denial is lying to oneself, and seeks to avoid reality and truth by saying something is not real or true."
1775,Therefore the person in denial does not want to know the truth and seeks to avoid it by suppression of thinking.
1776,"When bad things happen, they deny it is real."
1777,"This results in the person denying that God exists, and/or denying that Jesus Christ is the only Savior."
1778,They suppress thinking about death and God as a means of coping.
1779,"But using denial as a coping device to avoid the reality and truth about death, about God, and about His salvation offer to humans will lead to a miserable life after death."
1780,Once again we see how reality is not avoidable during eternity.
1781,"There are other false mental coping devices and variations of those discussed above, but again, it is not our purpose to cover them in detail, but rather to set up the discussion of what the Bible says about the inner human as related to false mental coping devices which are used to try to avoid reality and truth."
1782,Good question.
1783,The answer starts with what we have already discussed about the inner workings of the soul.
1784,"All humans are sinful, saved or unsaved."
1785,"God does not seek to punish us every time we go astray, but wants us to turn to Him."
1786,God is a loving and merciful God.
1787,"His Son took the punishment we deserved, therefore God can and does forgive His believers."
1788,"We must not labor under a sense of guilt for our past sins, because they have been paid for and taken away."
1789,"But we must seek to please God now and in the future, even though no one can do so perfectly."
1790,"And controlling the Sinful Nature is important to having a healthy soul, which is the point here, because the Sinful Nature is the source of soul distortions."
1791,"When a person alters the way their soul is supposed to operate, the soul becomes distorted and various levels of instability set in."
1792,The soul ceases to function in a logical and stable manner because some portions of the soul exert undue influence.
1793,"In fact, a revolt inside the soul occurs."
1794,And the primary offender as we have discussed is the Emotion in consort with the Sinful Nature.
1795,"And this is where false coping devices come into play, as they are used to distort the soul's normal thought processes."
1796,Therefore the ultimate culprit is the Sinful Nature which causes soul distortions and most mental illnesses.
1797,The soul becomes divided against itself.
1798,"This is where the saying ""he is of two minds"" applies."
1799,"It is usually a long slow slide into this level of soul distortion, and likewise it is a long process to get out."
1800,Rejection of truth is not usually a matter of intelligence (IQ).
1801,"The propensity for rejecting truth and therefore accepting untruths is primarily a matter of how the person's soul is functioning, not a matter of education or intellect."
1802,"And humility, which is the opposite of arrogance, plays a key role in truth acceptance."
1803,Truth can also be rejected for other reasons.
1804,"Some people simply do not care about spiritual issues, so they ignore them."
1805,Ignoring is rejecting.
1806,"People focus on their job, family and other things and do not stop to think about their eternal future, or they think there is no eternal future to think about."
1807,"Some have a simple form of relative righteousness, and think they are better than many other people they see around them so if there is a God He would favor them over those they see as morally inferior."
1808,Of course that is not true.
1809,"It is why so many conversations in life attempt to compare oneself with others, putting down others to build oneself up in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others."
1810,"In another vein, it is also why wealth is said to make salvation more difficult, since wealthy people think they have all they need without God so they may ignore spiritual issues."
1811,"These rejections of truth are more a matter of lack of interest or caring, but the end result is the same."
1812,The human spirit plays an important role in accepting Biblical truth.
1813,"For humans to interact with God they need a 149 human spirit, otherwise God cannot interact with them, and they cannot understand God or His spiritual truth."
1814,Truth is built on truth.
1815,"God is the author of logic and truth, and has given these as gifts to mankind."
1816,"Rejection of truth in one's belief system is therefore rejection of God and His plan, and the only alternative is a belief system based on fallacies, falsehoods, and lies."
1817,"Therefore the Bible has definitions of normality embedded in it, and they fit with everything He has designed."
1818,"Since God is the Designer, He gets to decide what is reality, and therefore what is ""normal"" and ""abnormal."""
1819,That means humans cannot change them no matter how hard they may try.
1820,"Since God has defined normality and abnormality, He also put ""reality stops"" in place on normality, past which abnormality is unleashed."
1821,"Humans periodically try to change the rules God has put in place, resulting in confusion, chaotic beliefs and mental dysfunction."
1822,"For instance, God made male and female humans."
1823,A male is a reality.
1824,A female is a reality.
1825,"When certain humans decide there is no such thing as male and female, they attempt to create new rules or standards for a new status, or maybe no rules at all."
1826,"There is no allowance for citing ""unfairness"" because once the reality stops which God put in place are bypassed and removed, there is no way to sort out what is right or wrong, fair or unfair, on the other side of reality."
1827,"So this is the first issue with reality stops, that there is no logic on the issue once reality is bypassed."
1828,Such people will try desperately to gain the approval of others for their belief system and resulting behavior.
1829,"They demand changes in law to force other humans to not only accept their beliefs and actions, but go far beyond that to demanding acceptance of their status as being ""normal."""
1830,"To reiterate a previously discussed issue, God is logical."
1831,He invented logic.
1832,"Logic aligns with who He is, what He is, and what He has designed and created."
1833,"The universe He created was completely logical and orderly in its original perfect form, although created beings, both angels and humans, distorted it with rebellion and sin."
1834,"The issue here is that when humans try to pass the reality stops which God has put in place, the result is illogical and cannot be made logical or reasonable."
1835,"As an aside, beyond the reality stops there is also no possibility of any true happiness."
1836,Humans who live beyond the reality stops God has put in place cannot find it.
1837,There are many other examples of humans trying to bypass the reality stops of normality of beliefs.
1838,These always result in internal friction and dysfunction.
1839,"Beliefs only make sense, and are only logical, when the boundaries of normality are left in place and respected as reality stops on beliefs and resulting behaviors."
1840,Humans have tried over the entirety of history to change the reality stops put in place by God.
1841,"Humans cannot repeat the original fall into sinfulness, because we already gained the Sinful Nature through the original humans."
1842,"The Mind and Heart cannot reconcile these discontinuities inside the soul, so internal chaos reigns."
1843,"But remember, truth is an extreme position."
1844,"So this middle ground approach is often a form of expressing a half-baked belief system, or no belief system at all."
1845,"The person may actually have beliefs, but maybe not."
1846,"There is a time and place to hold your tongue and express no beliefs, but on the other hand to never express beliefs is a form of cowardice."
1847,"And to actually have no specific and firm beliefs is a real problem, especially for believers."
1848,We are required to have firm beliefs in truth as revealed in the Bible.
1849,"Fluid beliefs are not actually beliefs, but rather are random musings aimed at just getting along."
1850,Such fluid beliefs are a failure to have anchoring principles on important issues.
1851,"As stated, God requires us to hold firm beliefs based in truth."
1852,We are saved by a belief in Jesus Christ.
1853,We must live by firm beliefs in what the Scriptures reveal.
1854,"To deny the fundamental beliefs revealed in the Bible is a spiritual failure, at least at that moment in time."
1855,"Recovery is possible and important, but the more we deny the truth the less we will believe it."
1856,Spiritual failure and loss of firm beliefs go hand in hand.
1857,Beliefs on fundamental issues matter.
1858,"There is truth, and there is non-truth."
1859,This belief system is one which takes the middle road to nowhere.
1860,"Atheists are at least honest that they reject something completely, and refuse to believe it."
1861,"The Agnostic belief system is therefore a lack of firm beliefs in things which are important, where the big issues are ignored because they are just too hard to deal with."
1862,Even Satan believes in God.
1863,"He is still going into eternal condemnation, but he certainly believes in God without any question."
1864,But believing in God will not save anyone.
1865,"It is believing in Jesus Christ as Savior which saves each person, and the lack of such belief condemns all who hold to it throughout their life on earth."
1866,"But being an Agnostic is living without beliefs, which means living without form or substance."
1867,It cannot allow truth to exist unopposed.
1868,"It cannot allow it to be expressed, or even believed."
1869,"Cosmic System beliefs are unsupportable, illogical, foolish, and do not work in the real world."
1870,They have no logic or basis in reality.
1871,Opposition by truth cannot be allowed.
1872,Truth is everything they are not.
1873,It is right and good and moral and virtuous and logical.
1874,The Cosmic System is none of those.
1875,Their first defense is to attack the person instead of the truth itself.
1876,The person must be socially destroyed.
1877,The person must be shunned.
1878,The person must be ridiculed.
1879,The person must be removed because the truth cannot be.
1880,The point here is that important belief systems based on the truth require defending.
1881,They will be attacked.
1882,There will be ridicule and social pressure.
1883,"But we see the results regularly, with severe impact on the lives of innocent people and families."
1884,"When the Sinful Nature and Emotion are allied, the result will be dysfunctional thinking on a scale from slight to hardened."
1885,"Lusts vary from person to person, so not all criminals are alike."
1886,"And we not discussing here those who have made mistakes, or committed a few petty crimes."
1887,"It is just another drug, but with perceived personal rewards."
1888,"Those who are in their way, or rivals, or can provide something they do not have, are just weak and need to make room for the ""more evolved,"" namely the Darwinian criminals."
1889,"But it is not truly mental ""illness"" since it has resulted from repeated bad decisions, not brain damage, usually over a long period of time."
1890,"But such mental dysfunction, as we would define it, is not a legitimate defense for criminal actions."
1891,"Arrogance, the chief output of the Sinful Nature, is taken to the extreme and self-image becomes highly distorted."
1892,At this point thoughts are instinctive and actions are animalistic.
1893,"Recall that God did not create humans with instincts, or as animals."
1894,"But humans can change themselves into both given enough distorted thinking over time, because it unleashes extreme arrogance from the Sinful Nature."
1895,"There are many reasons, and some criminals may start with getting a raw deal in life, as they see it."
1896,Every criminal made themselves into one.
1897,"And when power is added to the equation, the slide into criminal thinking and behavior is hastened."
1898,"These people are also hardened criminals, and use the power of their office to take away the rights and freedoms of individuals."
1899,"Herod died miserably within a short time and was succeeded by his son, who was also named Herod."
1900,Both had a very good chance to understand salvation.
1901,Both refused it.
1902,Let is look at these issues now.
1903,"We will be true humans, with our same soul and human spirit, but transformed into spiritual beings, whereby our human spirit will drive our soul as the dominant part of our eternal inner human."
1904,"Therefore both soul and human spirit will remain, but the human spirit will have priority because we can only interact with God as spirit."
1905,"Therefore our human spirit and soul will be in full harmony during eternity, so there will be no more inner power struggles or disagreements."
1906,"We will also have a much more powerful eternal body, with a very high IQ."
1907,"They never had a human spirit, and will not have one during eternity."
1908,They will retain their Sinful Nature and will be tormented by it.
1909,"They will be separated from God, and will be very unhappy."
1910,They will have a lowly body which feels pain.
1911,"It was their choice to make, and they chose wrong."
1912,This should motivate us to do something about that while there is time.
1913,"The answer is we will do things a lot like people did on earth while alive, except the focus will turn to serving and worshiping Jesus Christ."
1914,But believers will not turn into angels.
1915,We will not play harps while sitting on clouds.
1916,We will not all be equal.
1917,"More specifically, the existing Heaven will be combined into a ""new heavens and new earth"" and the existing universe will be destroyed."
1918,"There will be a New Jerusalem as the throne- 158 room of the Trinity, which will be a very large cube shaped structure with pearl gates and streets and walls like gold and diamonds."
1919,The original Tree of Life will be inside the New Jerusalem.
1920,Those who were spiritual winners will have higher level leadership roles supporting the leadership of the Lord.
1921,There will be assigned tasks and work in this societal structure.
1922,"It will also be a very social eternal society, with plenty of personal interaction, since structure and social interaction is important for the happiness of humans even in eternity."
1923,We will eat and drink.
1924,The new earth will be a paradise.
1925,"There will be no darkness, as the light of God will be everywhere at all times."
1926,All will have a resurrection body like Jesus Christ gained at His resurrection.
1927,But there will be differences in levels of happiness based on how well we fulfilled our spiritual life while believers on earth.
1928,And it will be mainly based on what we thought and believed while we were alive.
1929,"Now back to the reality of life on earth, and the current state of thoughts, thinking, and beliefs."
1930,Polarizations based on beliefs abound.
1931,"Belief systems are generally very shallow, mixed with those which are based on total unreality."
1932,"People are looking for ""meaning"" but look everywhere but to God, so they find none and become more frustrated."
1933,"As a result, many go even deeper into single-issue fanatical views in search of meaning in their life."
1934,And so the cycle continues downward.
1935,This is apparent everywhere we turn.
1936,"Each one believes the other is outrageously wrong, leading to polarization."
1937,"The difference now as opposed to the past is the degree to which social media can provide support for unreality of beliefs, and expand its impact exponentially."
1938,"Once again, look at the beliefs which currently consume people."
1939,"People pursue politics for the purpose of power, not for 160 service."
1940,"Money is used for the purpose of creating the illusion of importance in society, and a false sense of meaning in life."
1941,"Lust consumes people, which is the true opioid of the masses."
1942,"Justice systems support the criminal, as lawful people are called criminals, so the innocent are deemed guilty while criminals are praised."
1943,"Meanwhile, belief systems based on Bible truth have dwindled and are being persecuted."
1944,"Christian beliefs are now being called intolerant and even criminal, and portions of the Bible are called hate literature."
1945,"All of this madness is based on belief systems focused on the Sinful Nature and self-promotion, supported by the evil Cosmic System."
1946,The world is turned upside down by distorted beliefs.
1947,"When the majority of individuals in a nation think in such distorted patterns, that nation is headed for disaster."
1948,"The majority have their Emotion aligned with the Sinful Nature to a significant degree, so they think in distorted patterns, if you call that thinking."
1949,"When a maximum number of people in a society have gone this way, the effect on that society will be intensified."
1950,"Add the technology to expand the effects, and a critical mass of false belief systems will take over."
1951,"And when the whole world has gone that way, the results are what we see today."
1952,"Chaos of thoughts, thinking, and beliefs."
1953,"People are living on their Emotion, which cannot think, in alliance with the Sinful Nature, the instrument of lust and sin for humans."
1954,"The Mind and Heart are set aside as the leadership of the soul, leading to living by feelings and lust."
1955,"This eventually becomes a set pattern which the person may be unable to break, even if they desire to do so."
1956,"The more this condition persists, the more the duo of Emotion and Sinful Nature take control, and the harder it is to think logically."
1957,"When this condition dominates the nation and the world, attacks on truth, reason and logic start coming from all directions."
1958,"They blame those who seem happy and have firm beliefs, therefore Christianity becomes their main target."
1959,"It is blamed for interfering with their own empty search for happiness, and requiring them to think about their eventual death and the eternity beyond it."
1960,"But any life apart from God is an empty one, because God's plan for humans has no useful alternative."
1961,Both are lust-based systems.
1962,"Some others just drop out, preferring not to think about much at all, trying to avoid belief systems."
1963,"This approach has become a primary method of avoiding thoughts and beliefs, because technology has enabled such a state of being."
1964,Others use drugs or alcohol.
1965,"Many join a cause, trying to find meaning through a belief system based on saving something or helping with something."
1966,"Some become social climbers, and others focus on making money to the exclusion of all else in life."
1967,"Others become fanatics, highly focused on a singular belief issue."
1968,"People go in all types of directions seeking meaning in life, or trying to avoid life, which means avoiding their own thoughts by various forms of distraction."
1969,"But once people reject the truth, or simply avoid the truth, they have rejected the only real meaning and purpose in life."
1970,"Any belief system which denies, rejects or avoids the truth is doomed to unhappiness and failure."
1971,That is the status of the world today.
1972,Anarchy knocks at the door.
1973,"Throughout history there have always been pockets of people where truth has been held in high esteem, even though most of the world did not do so."
1974,"Pockets of truth have held the world together, but have dwindled and are fading fast."
1975,"The world has embraced false beliefs, distractionism, and evil."
1976,The results are obvious.
1977,"There is chaos of thoughts and beliefs, which has led to chaos of actions."
1978,"The world has rejected truth, because truth scares them to death."
1979,"But there is a solution.... 162 CHAPTER 23 RIGHT BELIEFS, RIGHT THOUGHTS At the beginning of this book we postulated that the Bible is the ultimate self-help book."
1980,"When it comes to real solutions involving the inner human, it is the only useful self-help book, because it is truth."
1981,"John 8:31 says “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples."
1982,No human has a perfect belief system from top to bottom.
1983,"But there are divine standards designed to guide us through our life, and especially our spiritual life."
1984,This book has pointed out many false assumptions about how humans think and form beliefs.
1985,"We now see that all of it occurs in the soul, not in the brain."
1986,"We discussed how the brain is a gateway between the soul and the outside world, enabling the soul to interface with the universe."
1987,"Let us also recall what we discussed about the issue of truth in beliefs, that all people think their own beliefs are ""true,"" or at least ""working"" for them."
1988,"By definition, people only believe what they think is true or close enough by their standards."
1989,And our core beliefs center on those things we believe are both true and most important in our lives.
1990,"So we asked ourselves whether truth is what each person thinks it is, or is there one true belief system?"
1991,"And if the latter, who gets to decide what is right or wrong, true or false, acceptable or unacceptable?"
1992,"There can be no other answer except ""God gets to decide."""
1993,"The only other choice is ""No one"" and humans cannot live with that answer."
1994,But they try.
1995,And they fail.
1996,And it works.
1997,"No other belief system reveals anything close to that, or has its power."
1998,Not if it is truth.
1999,"But others believe their opposing belief systems 163 are true, or something like it."
2000,We believe they are wrong about that.
2001,"Only because we want them to have eternal salvation, but we defend their right to choose."
2002,So we do not apologize for believing that the Bible is the truth.
2003,"For us, it is our core belief system and therefore it drives our thoughts and beliefs at all levels."
2004,"Imperfectly, of course."
2005,We are human.
2006,And forgiven.
2007,God does not have a dynamic and fluid belief system.
2008,Any other attempt by any other method will be rejected.
2009,"God made the most basic and necessary issue of our lifetime, which is our salvation or lack thereof, a matter of what we believe."
2010,"(Acts 16:31) Note that it is not thoughts which save us, but a single and very specific belief."
2011,That is not specific enough.
2012,"It is the salvation work of Jesus Christ which is the key, the belief that He is our Savior, which when believed is the moment we are eternally saved."
2013,Thoughts are not beliefs until they are accepted as true.
2014,But it is the acceptance of thoughts as true which turns them into beliefs.
2015,"If a thought which is accepted replaces a previous thought which was opposite, then the belief has changed to the new belief."
2016,Thoughts form beliefs only when the thought is accepted as true.
2017,And one single specific belief provides eternal salvation.
2018,There will be a lot of nice people who spend eternity in misery.
2019,Note that God made salvation a matter of beliefs.
2020,"Some might say, how can something so simple as a belief result in eternal salvation?"
2021,"I assume none of you would ask that, having read to this point."
2022,"We have seen how powerful beliefs are, and how they are the truest reflection of the inner human."
2023,Belief is acceptance.
2024,Belief is commitment.
2025,Belief is trust in the one providing the information.
2026,"Beliefs are not ""something simple."""
2027,"Therefore God did not make salvation a matter of being ""good"" to some relative degree, but rather a matter of what the individual believes."
2028,That is the ultimate reason for this book.
2029,"God did the work, and Jesus Christ made the sacrifice."
2030,"Humans must simply believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior, in their soul as we have learned, to accept the free gift, the most difficult thing God ever did, which was sacrificing His only Son for all of us."
2031,Nothing.
2032,"Those who reject salvation by faith through grace will never gain a human spirit, which is required to interact and live with God."
2033,There is no incremental earning of a human spirit.
2034,"It cannot be achieved by being good enough, or by working hard enough, because the soul alone cannot please God or interact with Him."
2035,It requires the human spirit as a partner which can interact with and please God.
2036,"When the two parts of the inner human work in tandem, God hears and provides His divine favor."
2037,"If there is only a soul, God waits for the belief to occur."
2038,Thoughts and beliefs.
2039,"As we conclude, there is such a thing as right core beliefs."
2040,God gave us the Bible to define them and to show us how we can develop them.
2041,"In the final analysis, these are the same."
2042,"Truth always comes back to the Bible, even when it is rejected."
2043,"God is not arbitrary about what He believes and what He requires of us, but He can only support that which is right and true because He designed us and the universe."
2044,Our soul and human spirit were designed to function on truth.
2045,When we function on anything else there will be distortions.
2046,"It is like putting diesel fuel into a gasoline car and saying ""all fuel is just fuel, so all is acceptable."""
2047,"The truth is beneficial to the inner human, and everything else does some degree of harm if it is believed."
2048,"After salvation God makes our life about believing the Bible as His truth, and to use it as our source of knowing, understanding, and loving Him."
2049,They are not.
2050,He gets to decide.
2051,His Word tells us what He believes.
2052,As believers we must align our thoughts and beliefs with His.
2053,"If the soul becomes damaged the road back is long and hard, but there is at least a narrow road back."
2054,"The decimated soul can be rehabilitated, but there is only one answer, and the Bible provides the solution."
2055,The soul can only be rehabilitated by the Word of God.
2056,The damage was done by believing falsehoods and lies.
2057,Only truth can repair and undo the damage.
2058,"And truth only comes from God, which He has revealed to us in the Bible."
2059,"Learning the Bible, the Word of God, is the only means of rehabilitation."
2060,"Not at a casual level, but by a deep understanding and belief in what it reveals."
2061,"It is spiritual food, nourishment for the soul."
2062,"Therefore all proper, correct, accurate, noble, and worthy beliefs are rooted and grounded in what God has told us, and that is revealed in the Bible."
2063,It must therefore be the guide for our beliefs.
2064,"And what we believe will drive our thinking, and then our actions."
2065,The process of recovery is full of setbacks and pain.
2066,"But how could it be otherwise, since the slide into the abyss was a long and involved process of slow destruction."
2067,"Such damage cannot be overcome in a short time, or without pain and setbacks."
2068,"Unlike learning math or physics or a hobby, the Word has spiritual power in and of itself, and it can be harnessed if it is taken into the human spirit."
2069,"But knowledge puffs up while love builds up."""
2070,"The Word of God is the source of love, unlike all other religions."
2071,"Therefore, growing spiritually allows us to have greater and greater fellowship with God."
2072,When this happens the Bible says the person has a good Heart and a sound Mind.
2073,"God gave us free will to choose, primarily for or against Him and His plan, but also for most other things in life."
2074,"If humans did not have truly free will, they would be merely puppets and their choices would not be true ones, and therefore they could not appreciate and love God."
2075,"However, it is this free will which changed the entire course of human history and led to all the distortions covered in this book."
2076,"The answer is: ""truth."""
2077,"God wants us to believe what He has told us because it is the truth, which is only found in the Bible."
2078,"When we reject what God says is truth, we look for substitutes."
2079,"The substitutes are various forms of untruth, from living on emotion to believing in a religious system other than that found in the Bible."
2080,"However, most humans just want to avoid thinking and believing very much at all."
2081,"Apart from the Biblical view of what our thoughts and beliefs should be, there is no other useful source or authority."
2082,Therefore we must learn what He requires of us.
2083,Humans were designed by God to think and form beliefs.
2084,"God did not design us to function on a belief system which is based on false information, half- truths, or lies."
2085,"Humans have a soul which requires information to function, to think, to form and hold beliefs."
2086,"But those beliefs can be right or wrong, truth or lie, good or bad."
2087,"We were designed to function on the belief system revealed in the Bible, which is truth, because it is the Word of God -- His truth."
2088,The inner human will live forever.
2089,Our thoughts and beliefs will determine our happiness both on earth and for all eternity.
2090,That makes them very powerful things.
2091,Thoughts and beliefs have eternal implications.
2092,Choose them wisely.
